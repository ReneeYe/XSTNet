hello , mother . - why did you come back ?
after all these years , why now ? - so , you 're max@@ ine 's daughter ...
i 've been talking to the same three people for , like , 10 years .
so it 's really nice to@@ - - talk to someone new , i get it .
but sometimes i wish my life was simp@@ ler .
i want you to come home , ab@@ . i want us to be okay again .
what happened is done .
it will be just something else ; another con@@ spir@@ acy .
boss , your old man died in prison because of this guy .
i told you , when i was ready , we 'd deal with mitch mcdeere .
it 's time . - i 'm sorry guys , we 're closed .
mitch mcdeere , i 've thinking about this moment since i was 15 years old .
you know why i 'm here ? - go on , you son of a bitch .
get it over with . - i don 't wanna kill you .
i wanna hire you .
when i was 15 years old i made a promise to find you .
and i 'm a man who takes his promi@@ ses very seriously .
i know abby and claire are in ken@@ tu@@ cky .
i know ta@@ mmy is working on her di@@ vor@@ ce in ten@@ nes@@ see .
what do you want ?
i told you. i want to hire you .
a friend of mine has been char@@ ged with murder here in d. c .
his name is patrick wal@@ k@@ er. i want you to repre@@ sent him .
you 're not serious .
you let me know what it is about my t@@ one that suggests i 'm not serious .
he 's a good friend .
he 's been framed for a crime he didn 't comm@@ it , and i want him out .
i don 't handle r@@ ack@@ et ca@@ se@@ s. or@@ gan@@ ized crime is speci@@ ali@@ zed .
you need a lawyer - - i know what i need !
he 's not part of my fami@@ l@@ y. he 's an economist .
went to school at mit .
works for a big think @-@ tank here in town ;
spen@@ ds his days thinking about job crea@@ tion and trade def@@ ic@@ its .
who did he kill ? - nobody .
a woman , alle@@ ge@@ dly ; not that she 's nobody , but like i said , he was framed .
joey , i 'm just a gu@@ y. i never even knew your father .
i 'd jo@@ ined a firm in me@@ mp@@ his and everything went wrong .
i never te@@ sti@@ fied - - you hel@@ ped the fe@@ ds !
you took down the law firm , which took down my father .
you cannot blame me for ...
i 'm sorry , i didn 't realize we were having a debate .
whose turn is it , yours or mine ?
here 's my off@@ er. you are gonna handle the case .
that 's what you 're gonna do for me .
if you do , the mcdeere and morolto families will be squ@@ are .
that 's what i 'm gonna do for you .
why me ? - because this is what you do best :
un@@ cover the truth .
in me@@ mp@@ his ... now with no@@ bel insurance , you see what other lawyers don 't .
and , uh ...
most lawyers just want to win .
you need to win .
a good boss knows how to in@@ cen@@ ti@@ vise his employees .
and if i say no ? - you 've two choices , mitch .
you can do this for me , or you can wait until we leave , call louis co@@ le@@ man and you can run .
maybe i won 't find you. but i promise you this ...
i won 't stop looking .
i 'll be back in the morning .
if you 're here , i 'll know i have a lawyer .
if you 're not , i 'll know i don 't .
i can 't believe he just walked into the office . - they have been watching us for months .
so why not do something so@@ on@@ er ? why now ? - the case .
he 's keeping us alive so we can get his friend released .
and what st@@ op@@ s him from killing us after ? - nothing. his promise .
we can run. not with the fe@@ ds , on our own .
we 've always had a back@@ up plan . - which would work if we were all together .
we need to make a decision right now .
do we call louis ? - or what , work for the mob ?
are you really considering this ? - yeah , of course i 'm considering this , ray .
it 's because the alter@@ na@@ tive is to call my wife , who has just been through a living hell , and tell her that we are running again .
so instead , you 're gonna tell her you 're working for joey morolto ?
look , if we can get morolto out of our lives then maybe she will come back and we will be okay .
but even if you do this , we are nowhere near okay .
let 's just talk to the client ; one meeting .
morolto said that he is not mob ; that he is an economist . - i don 't like it .
if something goes wrong we get the hell out of here .
okay , fine. do it .
call louis .
one meeting .
unfortunately , i do still have to charge you for our sessions .
really ?
i know you were hoping for that aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ lu@@ de on the b@@ al@@ con@@ y with your ther@@ a@@ pi@@ st disc@@ ount , but ...
well , it only seems fair .
is that what you are now , my ther@@ a@@ pi@@ st ?
you know , i might take it personally if you hire someone else .
i 'm just saying ,
i @-@ i don 't know how the board of eth@@ ics would feel about you kissing a patient .
i mean , that was you wasn 't it ? you know , it was pretty dark out there .
no , no , that was me . - so ... ?
so ... so i think you need to schedule an a@@ ppoin@@ tment right away .
how 's tomorrow at two ?
two 's good .
hey , um that 's my other line .
i gotta go . - yeah , yeah , go .
see you then .
hey ! - hey .
glad i caught you . - yeah , you caught me .
hey so , my dad 's taking claire to work with him at the bank today .
and my mom inv@@ ited me to lunch .
so , how 's it going ?
it 's ... it 's not so good , - but we 'll see how it goes today . - i miss you .
i know i 'm supposed to be giving you space , but i just wanted to ...
i just wanted to call and say it . - i miss you too .
look , a client just walked in the offic@@ e. can i call you back ?
yeah . - ta@@ mmy , i gotta run .
i 'll call you back . - may i ?
you know , i never liked these but i 've heard rea@@ gan ate ' em .
he did all right for himself , huh ?
you 're here - guess that means you 're in . - not exactly .
we want a meeting with the client . - i can save you the trip .
he 's innocent .
how do you know that ? - he told me .
you 'll find most people don 't lie to me . - you know what i think ?
i think if you wanted to kill us you would have done it by now , but you didn 't .
you wa@@ ited , you know why ? because this case
this guy , he ma@@ tters to you .
you don 't want us to take this case , you need us to take this case .
i need a meeting .
antonio ? - yeah , boss ?
get the car . -@@ get the car .
this is him ?
mitch mcdeere , patrick walker .
something wrong ? - i 'm thinking .
are you thinking if something 's wrong ?
i 'm thinking three button suit , which means you will follow tr@@ ends .
i 'm thinking do i want a lawyer who follows tr@@ ends ?
patrick ... - i 'm thinking char@@ co@@ al gre@@ y feels safe and predictable .
do i want a lawyer who 's safe and predictable ? - hey ! di@@ al it back .
here 's what i 'm thinking - one and two button su@@ its are worn by prosecu@@ tors .
double @-@ brea@@ sted , by mob lawyers , which i inv@@ ite you to hire .
fair enough .
i 'm thinking tri@@ als are about per@@ su@@ a@@ sion , which means about juries .
juries want comfor@@ t , not excitement .
they want to trust the guy who 's asking them to put an alle@@ ged killer back out on the street .
i 'm thinking , do i want a client who is sure that he is the smar@@ test guy in the room when i have been here for 30 secon@@ ds and i know that he is clearly not ?
i like him . - told you .
sorry. you know the charge ?
i know it 's a murder char@@ ge@@ . i don 't know anything about the victim .
yeah , well neither do i. her name is charlotte miller and that 's all they told me .
you must know something . - i know where i went out for drin@@ ks after work .
ro@@ ma , one of my family clu@@ bs here in town . - it 's a restaurant / bar , very up@@ sca@@ le .
you never saw the victim ? - i don 't even know who she is .
i went home , took off my suit and went out again .
there was a poker game at a place called the pal@@ ace .
i was in my car and all of a su@@ dden there were these lights behind me , pulling me over .
were you drunk ? - i didn 't think so@@ . i was fine .
but this cop wants to give me a breathalyser .
i ble@@ w a . 0@@ 8 . - that 's legally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
barely . - they arrested me and then imp@@ ounded the car .
and i guess they found a ... suitcase in the trunk .
cops said she was stu@@ ff@@ ed in@@ side@@ . un@@ dre@@ ssed and strang@@ led .
the victim 's body was found in the trunk of your car ?
he didn 't kill her - like i said , he was framed .
i know how this looks , but i 'm telling you .
man to man .
i have never met charlotte miller .
time 's up , mitch .
are you in or out ?
you took the case ? - i said we 're in .
" we 're out " really didn 't seem work@@ able in the moment .
so , you think this patrick was framed ? - un@@ likely .
a killer puts a strange woman in an innocent economist 's trunk ?
i said " un@@ likely " .
but you gotta admit , it is possible .
a body in a suitcase is easily por@@ table .
they 'd sli@@ p it in his trunk when he 's at the bar , or when he 's back at his apartment .
so , we 're doing this ? we 're trying to figure this out ?
the first sign of trouble , we back out and we run .
we 're already at the 1@@ 5th sign of trouble . - you can 't have it both ways , ray .
you can 't do this and give me crap for doing it .
okay , what do you want me to do ?
patrick said that he was on his way to a poker game when he got pulled over .
ver@@ i@@ fy if the poker game was happening that night . - and what are you doing ?
i 'm gonna go to the u@@ . s. attorney 's office , see if the prosecutor has a theory .
and if so , we need to know what it is .
you dre@@ w this case ?
don 't worry , this one doesn 't invol@@ ve national security .
i 'll tell you what i know , but you won 't want to hear it . - my client didn 't even know the victim .
you believe him ?
well , it 's my job to believe him until you prove otherwise .
your job ? since when do you re@@ p walker ?
i thought i was dealing with bar@@ ry vance on this one . - vance is out ; i 'm in .
fine by me. vance is a mob lawyer m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece .
really ? - your boy 's connected .
word is walker is tight with joey morolto of chicago .
nah , they 're old frien@@ d@@ s. he 's not even mo@@ b. not even it@@ ali@@ an .
look , i gotta turn this foo@@ tage over to you any@@ ways , so you might as well see it while you 're here .
that 's walker 's building ; freight elevator at the end of the third floor hall .
you 'll no@@ te it 's 2 : 0@@ 4 , about 12 minutes before your boy gets pulled over .
that 's the suitcase with charlotte miller inside .
there 's a camera in the lo@@ bby elev@@ at@@ or. that 's why he 's using the freight .
but he didn 't know they put one in here a few months ago .
how do you know the suitcase isn 't empty ?
whe@@ els get caught ; he uses both hands to pull the bag on .
you know why ? it we@@ i@@ gh@@ s 1@@ 1@@ 7 p@@ ounds .
circum@@ stan@@ tial . - like hell .
charlotte miller is in that bag@@ . we also found her clothes .
her clothes were in his building ?
they were bun@@ d@@ led up with your client 's sheets and thrown down the trash ch@@ ute .
not smart .
he must have been moving pretty quic@@ k@@ ly , which is why i don 't think he meant to kill her .
man@@ s@@ laughter ? - rough sex gone wrong ...
they met at ro@@ ma , went back to his place ; things got a little hot and hea@@ vy ...
you want my theory , there you have it .
i thought we were having lunch . - we are .
now , before you look at these , i want a quick opinion , not a big to @-@ do .
your father men@@ tion@@ ed that you b@@ al@@ anc@@ ed the books for your little firm at home .
pat@@ ron@@ i@@ zing , con@@ de@@ scen@@ ding and vaguely sex@@ ist , but i am going to choose not to see it that way .
i 'm gonna choose to see it as you asking me for help .
you know i 'm not very good with money .
well , you were always better at spending it than you were with ac@@ counting for it .
rude , ob@@ no@@ xious , vaguely sex@@ ist ...
okay , what 's the problem ? - the bu@@ d@@ get for the community cen@@ t@@ re .
we get signific@@ ant fun@@ ding from the state every year , but if you look at what we spend on the children it doesn 't ad@@ d up .
dr. wilson men@@ tion@@ ed that .
really ? during one of your sessions ?
is that you have an ac@@ coun@@ tant ? - yes we do .
his name is charles fin@@ ley .
he took over for mar@@ tin gor@@ ha@@ m when he passed last year .
nice man ... - but ?
but mar@@ tin had a led@@ ger@@ . he kept everything by hand .
since charles has come on board , we can 't seem to find it .
that 's con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent . - and sus@@ pic@@ ious , i agree .
we can 't comp@@ are the new numbers with the old ones without that ledger .
charles says he simply mi@@ spl@@ ac@@ ed it , but it does make me wonder .
nice place . - yeah , what brings you in ?
um , mitch is gonna come down and have a talk with joey .
maybe not the best time ; things are pretty ten@@ se .
can i get you something , sir ? - nah , i 'm good thanks .
they tell me you were inside , br@@ ush@@ y m@@ oun@@ tain@@ . yeah , i did a 15 year b@@ id .
did a nic@@ k@@ el myself at jo@@ li@@ et .
so this ... patrick ... why is the boss so inv@@ est@@ ed ?
what , you guys gonna get him out ? - i don 't know .
he already lied about the poker game , so that 's not a good way to start .
yeah , you guys need to do somethin ' . boss likes patrick .
he tru@@ sts him . - yeah , why ?
the kid 's crazy smar@@ t. helps joey with all the business stuff .
right now , he 's the guy joey tru@@ sts the most .
patrick lie@@ d. i just talked to the prosecutor .
everything patrick told us was a lie .
you wanna sit ?
her clothes were in his building .
they found them wrapped up in his sheets and thrown down the inc@@ in@@ er@@ ator ch@@ ute .
damn ... - you knew ?
patrick told me the clothes were g@@ one. burned .
they have him on video getting on the elevator 12 minutes before the cops picked him up .
with the suitcase . - no , there weren 't any camer@@ as .
they were in@@ sta@@ lled two months ago .
now look , i don 't know what your ang@@ le is , joey , but i will give you my profession@@ al opinion .
patrick is going to prison . - that doesn 't work for me .
the prosecutor thinks it 's man@@ s@@ laughter .
i say we run with that offer and plea@@ d it out .
okay , he lie@@ d. we lied .
but the case is the same ; he was framed . - you don 't believe that ...
when he got back to his apartment the girl was there .
he found her in his be@@ d. what was he supposed to do ?
she was dea@@ d. strang@@ led , half na@@ ked ...
it was a set @-@ up . - why didn 't he call you ? ask for help ?
i don 't know. he was drinking .
if he had , we wouldn 't be here right now . - i 'm out. i want out of this .
you 're not out ; you got a wife and kid , remember ?
to hell with this , we 're getting pla@@ yed . - yeah , i 'm starting to get that im@@ pression .
this patrick guy is a real piece of work ; stone @-@ cold li@@ ar .
he 's a lot more than that , broth@@ er. i think he 's joey 's close@@ st ad@@ visor .
meaning what ? - meaning our new client is not just an economist .
he 's joey 's new consigliere .
we spent all that time and money protec@@ ting you and your family from the chicago mob
i was gonna tell you . - i got shot helping abby with the no@@ ble case .
i broke you and ray out of j@@ a@@ il .
i ris@@ ked my career and joey morolto wal@@ t@@ zes through your front door and i have to read about it in a surveillance report ?
are you still watching me ? - no , not you , him .
the fbi trac@@ ked him from chicago to d. c .
but they didn 't know to warn you because you left the pro@@ gra@@ m .
hey look , it 's not like i asked to see him. he found me .
and off@@ ered you a job .
and your bra@@ ins are so sc@@ ra@@ mb@@ led after no@@ ble insurance you said yes .
how did you know that ? - i 'm a federal agent , mitch .
you signed the visit@@ ing log at a prison@@ . and yes , let me tell you something .
we know about patrick walker . - then you know that i didn 't have a cho@@ ice .
joey made me an offer : i either take the case and we 're squ@@ are , or run .
and you believe him ?
you think you do this one thing for him. he 's just gonna forget that you put his father in prison ?
i was trying to protect my family . - i should just let you do this .
i should just walk away .
didn 't all this start because you didn 't want to be a mob lawyer ?
louis , what do you want me to say ? - let 's go .
where ? - the fbi .
you wanna work for joey morolto , you need to see what you 're getting into .
this is your cli@@ en@@ t. he 's one of joey morolto 's top lieuten@@ ants .
mitch , it 's the wrong time to get involved with the morol@@ tos .
there 's a ma@@ j@@ or rift in the family .
over what ? - over the future .
joey is the next gener@@ ation of the mob .
he under@@ stan@@ ds that the golden age is over .
he wants to move the family conne@@ ctions to move into le@@ gi@@ timate busine@@ sses .
and so , what 's the problem ? - you 're looking at ' em here .
these guys , they don 't care about le@@ gi@@ timate busine@@ sses .
they run vice oper@@ ations , lo@@ an shar@@ king , gambling , hi@@ j@@ ac@@ king ;
they 're not too happy about being pushed aside .
they don 't like the boss listening to patrick walker .
exactly , joey 's already got a consigliere , antonio cer@@ v@@ ino .
how do you think he feels about the new kid in town ?
your client .
ma@@ dge , it 's char@@ ley fin@@ d@@ le@@ y. i found those in@@ vo@@ ices you wanted .
okay , charles , i 'm be@@ tting you still have that ledger .
a rift ? - it makes sense ; joey 's headed in a new direction .
this guy , what 's his name ? - antonio ... something .
anton@@ i@@ o. he 's upset about being replac@@ ed , so he figu@@ res out a way to elimin@@ ate the competition .
so you think antonio framed patrick , but a couple of hours ago you were convinc@@ ed that patrick was guilty .
it 's possi@@ ble@@ . it is possible , right ?
oh , yeah right . - i don 't care about the truth .
we argue it , it gets us reason@@ able doubt ; gets us off the hook with joey .
what ? - nothing , just ... you are not car@@ ing about the truth .
we 've come a long way .
look , if we 're gonna do this you need to talk to joey .
antonio 's still his top lieuten@@ ant. gonna have to clear it with him first .
what are you doing ? - i 'm max@@ ine su@@ ther@@ land 's daughter .
this is a private offic@@ e. that 's my private pro@@ per@@ ty .
this is not your ... - you had no right to come in here .
i 'm taking this . - you will do no such thing .
ben , dr. wilson !
abby , what 's going on ? are you all right ? - ben , the ledger ...
charles has it ; it 's in his desk . - what ledger ?
the one that he claims is missing . - this woman broke into my office .
it 's right there under his de@@ sk@@ top . - abby ...
it 's right there. he 's stea@@ lin@@ g@@ . money 's missing , you said so yourself .
charles , i 'm sorry . - what ?
this woman 's a patient and i 've been counse@@ lling her .
she had no right breaking into your office . - you 'd better get her out of here .
now .
what was that ? i was about to ask you the same thing .
you did nothing. all you had to do was open his desk .
exactly , abby , his de@@ sk@@ . you can 't just break into somebody 's office .
okay , let 's get one things straight .
you and i have had some con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions but you are not counse@@ lling me , and i am not your patient .
you know , after that maybe you should be .
my father was 4@@ 3 when they made him boss .
me ? i 'm a leg@@ acy .
i in@@ her@@ ited this family .
that 's why people under@@ esti@@ mate me .
some even question my view of the future .
listen morolto , we don 't under@@ esti@@ mate you and we mean you no dis@@ respect .
but it is pretty clear that you are listening to the advice of patrick walker rather than your consigliere .
no . - you trust patrick , it makes sense that antonio would feel th@@ rea@@ ten@@ ed .
i said no .
my consigliere has been with this family for 40 years .
he 's ser@@ ved my father with lo@@ ve. it doesn 't have to be the truth .
we can take that argument to the j@@ ur@@ y. it can get us reason@@ able doubt .
you 're asking for permission to acc@@ use my top lieutenant of fra@@ ming patrick ?
yes .
i can 't do that .
find another way to win .
you and i need to talk .
if it were up to me , you 'd be dead .
killed you myself months ago when we found you .
joey s@@ r. was more than my boss .
i would have taken a bullet for him .
the fact that you 're breathing , and he 's not ...
it off@@ ends me .
i assume you know this .
i was over@@ ru@@ led by his son , so that was that .
loyalty , respect , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine
what goes on between me and my boss is between me and my boss .
so , the next time you question my loyalty ...
you remember something .
my loyalty 's the only reason you 're alive .
hello ?
sorry to inter@@ rup@@ t. i thought i might find you here .
um , no problem , we were just finishing up .
this is the assi@@ stant u@@ . s. attorney , all@@ an har@@ per .
this is antonio - i 'm sorry , i @-@ i don 't ...
know your full name .
nice company you 're keeping .
h@@ m , what have you got there ?
well , speaking of people who 'd pre@@ fer to remain anonymous , we 've got some new disco@@ very on the walker case .
it turns out what we gave you wasn 't complete .
apparently your client 's car wasn 't stopped so@@ le@@ ly because of his erratic driving .
which he den@@ ies .
the officer was respon@@ ding to an anonymous tip rela@@ yed through the 911 oper@@ ator .
a tip ?
repor@@ ting that your client was drunk and where his car would be .
my client says he was fra@@ me@@ d. now , hang on .
the tip suppor@@ ts his defen@@ ce. the caller could have been a set @-@ up .
that call could have come from anyone .
pa@@ ssing mo@@ tor@@ i@@ sts who saw him wea@@ ving . - which i am moving to suppre@@ ss .
then you 'll lo@@ se. the search was good , mitch .
no judge is gonna to@@ ss a body in that trunk .
right , so that 's why you came here , to see my reaction ?
because you 're not nervous ...
hey. thank you for coming .
you walked away pretty angry to@@ da@@ y. could you blame me ?
i 'm sorry. i was caught a little off guard .
you sold me out , b@@ en. you sold out the kids who need treatment .
why , because i wouldn 't break into a coll@@ ea@@ gue 's desk ?
because he 's stea@@ ling , ben , and we had the evidence .
but instead of holding him ac@@ coun@@ table , you apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ zed to him for my beha@@ vi@@ our .
well , if you knew he was stea@@ ling , you should have called the police .
i didn 't know. that 's why i was investigating .
investigating ? do you hear yourself , abby ?
look , i 'm sorry i disappointed you .
but pretty much any guy you would have called at that moment would have done the same thing .
i can think of one who wouldn 't. yeah ...
why did you kiss me ? because i wanted to .
why did you kiss me back ? i don 't have a good answer for that .
try .
the day you met me you knew i was running , and i am .
and the pills ...
and you are a reaction to being scared .
and you know what ?
as tired as i am , i think i am mostly tired of being scared .
spoke to the brothers mcdeere today .
word is we 've got an internal proble@@ m. what kind of a problem ?
a rift .
their word , not min@@ e. a divi@@ de , a split
i know what a rift is . - good .
you know i plan to take this family leg@@ it .
you know that 's our fu@@ tu@@ re. mr. morolto
you know patrick ?
he 's part of that plan .
he 's helping me shape that plan , and i understand why that might upset you .
senior morolto , i don 't know what i 've done to deserve your dis@@ respect .
but after 40 years , do i really have to de@@ cl@@ are my loyalty ?
no .
i assume your loyalty .
as my consigliere , you 're here because i want your advice .
is there a rift , a divi@@ de , a split , a problem
i need to know about ?
no .
got it ; 12 second call from 911 .
did you listen to it ? - no .
yeah , i 'm calling about a drunk driver hea@@ ding south from virginia a@@ ven@@ ue , near vic@@ tor@@ ia b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard .
he 's in an ' 09 black b@@ m@@ w 5 ser@@ ies , about 3@@ 0. dark hair , dark jack@@ et ...
you better get out there before he kills some@@ bo@@ dy. that 's why the cops stopped patrick .
what do you think that 's someone calling from the road ? no way ; too quiet , too specifi@@ c .
not enough road no@@ ise - i don 't think that was from a moving vehicle .
no , i agree .
if patrick walker was framed that is probably the voice of the man who did it .
i didn 't know they 'd put a camera on the freight elevator .
yeah , we kind of figure that .
or about the victim 's clothes , which were found wrapped in your sheets ?
i pan@@ ic@@ ked. i told you the truth , okay ?
i don 't know charlotte miller and i didn 't kill her. i don 't believe him .
i found her in my be@@ d@@ room .
i mean , yeah i left that part out , but it doesn 't change anything .
whether somebody put her in my bed , or my car , i was still framed .
i don 't know what to believ@@ e. but we did find something .
you weren 't pulled over for erratic dri@@ v@@ ing. the cop who stopped you got an anonymous tip .
what kind of a tip ? a 911 call saying exactly where you were .
i told you , see , that shows that i was framed .
well , it 's a star@@ t. i wasn 't drunk .
legally , maybe , but i was driving fine. somebody wanted that cop to stop me .
who knew you were drinking ? no@@ bo@@ dy. i don 't know .
maybe the guys at joey 's clu@@ b , but they 're not the kind to call the police .
yeah , well maybe your friends in the morolto family aren 't feeling so friendly these days .
what does that mean ? it means maybe you got too close to the boss .
you know , pi@@ ssing off g@@ ang@@ sters can be bad for your hea@@ lth .
you think this was an inside job ? one of joey 's guys ?
you ask that like it hasn 't oc@@ cur@@ red to you .
which i find interesting considering your int@@ el@@ li@@ gen@@ ce .
look , there are rules about when cops can use anonymous ti@@ ps .
they can 't just search because someone called them .
the tip has to be suff@@ ici@@ ently re@@ li@@ ab@@ le. and you don 't think it was ?
maybe no@@ t. i filed motion to suppre@@ ss. so , what happens if we win ?
then the search is out , the police had no right to stop you , and then anything found in the trunk is in@@ admi@@ ssi@@ ble .
even a body ? yes .
the prosecutor wouldn 't be allowed to connect the body to the car .
the only thing left would be the victim 's clothes .
and that 's no enough to charge murder@@ . no , probably not .
so , we could be one hearing away from free@@ dom ? both of us .
you said claire liked books ?
i 'll have it shi@@ pped to your hou@@ se. she 's gonna love it , dad .
hey , i 've been doing a lot of thinking and
and it 's time for you two to go. we 'll see you soon .
i had a feeling .
your mother told me about the dr. wilson situation .
what situation ? you finding the ledger .
you know , some things never change .
you never could bear the idea of anyone getting away with anything .
i never could , could i ?
you @-@ you broke into the man 's office , ab@@ by. i had to know .
i know that it sounds crazy , dad - but , i ...
no it doesn 't ; it doesn 't sound crazy .
you always were bra@@ ve , fearless .
you had to know the tru@@ th@@ . it sounds like you .
it sounds like mitch .
i 've been bla@@ ming him
re@@ sen@@ ting him for where we are , but it 's @-@ it 's not just him .
that in@@ stin@@ ct , that nee@@ ding to know - that 's in me too .
i missed you .
i wish mom and i had conne@@ c@@ ted. she wants to .
don 't give up on her. try one more time before you go .
i pulled behind the vehicle dri@@ ven by a white male .
an ' 09 black b@@ m@@ w 5 ser@@ ies - saw what i obser@@ ved to be erratic driving .
ob@@ je@@ c@@ tion. su@@ sta@@ ined ; you 'll need to be more specifi@@ c , officer .
var@@ ying spee@@ ds , a s@@ light wea@@ ve within the lan@@ es , so i hit the lights and made him stop .
and what exactly did you obser@@ ve ? the defendant ; he mat@@ ched the description .
he had a breath min@@ t in his mouth , but it didn 't mask the smell of alcohol .
i re@@ mo@@ ved him from his car and asked him to take a breathalyser ex@@ am .
and did he ? yes .
let the record re@@ fle@@ ct the results of that breathalyser , . 0@@ 8 .
the defendant was legally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , so i arrested him and imp@@ ounded his vehicle .
the body was found later on that night during a r@@ out@@ ine inv@@ en@@ tory search of the trunk at the yard .
no further questions .
you don 't know who called in that tip , do you ? no , sir .
you never even heard it. that 's correct .
so , you couldn 't say whether or not the caller was cre@@ di@@ ble .
you couldn 't even form an opinion as to whether or not they were telling the truth .
he was right about everything .
but you didn 't know that when you stopped my client .
he gave us the correct make and model of the car , the location , the description of the driver ...
so , that 's all it takes ?
if i de@@ scri@@ be somebody ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely enough that warrants a search ?
he was driving erra@@ ti@@ ca@@ ll@@ y. he vari@@ ed his spee@@ ds .
he s@@ lo@@ wed down because there was a police car behind him .
the car was wea@@ v@@ ing. so you say , but it was within the l@@ ane .
it wasn 't even outside of the line .
was he speeding ? he was drunk .
look , the call said to stop him before he killed someone .
that imp@@ lies that he was seen driving erra@@ tically .
i see , so you based your decision on what the caller imp@@ lied
ob@@ je@@ ction ! over@@ ru@@ led .
you don 't even know that he was drunk , do you ?
what ma@@ tters is what you knew when you made the stop .
already ? i @-@ i think it 's time .
i needed space to get per@@ spe@@ c@@ tive , and i have that now .
i know what i wan@@ t. mitch .
yes. because you love the witness protection pro@@ gra@@ m .
it was your life 's drea@@ m come tru@@ e. i 'm not gonna argue with you , mom .
and now that you 've been out for under a year , look what 's happened .
i 'm glad you got to meet claire .
i hope you can see now , abby ; now you have claire .
i hope you realize how hard it would be to see your child make choices that you think will hurt her .
she 's my daughter , mom .
there 's nothing she could do that would make me push her out of my life .
i thought ...
i ho@@ ped that we could find space in our lives for each other , but maybe that just can 't happen now .
nice jo@@ b. we 'll see .
no judge wants to gr@@ ant suppre@@ ssion in a murder case .
if we lose ? well , then we 'll argue that he was framed .
you know our pri@@ me suspect ? he came to see me in my office last night .
wasn 't too happy about me doub@@ ting his loyalty .
really ? he came to see you without my permission ?
don 't worry , counse@@ ll@@ or. it 's under control .
you do your job , i 'll do mine .
a young woman has been murdered and her family deserves justice .
it 's easy to fo@@ c@@ us only on that , but my job is to also care about justice for the acc@@ used .
in some st@@ ates the law simply doesn 't re@@ qui@@ re that anonymous ti@@ ps on drunk dri@@ vers be corrobor@@ ated .
the tip it@@ self is enough to ju@@ sti@@ fy an officer 's search .
in other st@@ ates the tip must be preci@@ se and predi@@ ct certain facts that the officer can corrobor@@ ate on the scene .
when a split like this oc@@ cur@@ s we expect the su@@ pre@@ me court to decide .
they had a chance last year , in a case from virginia , but they de@@ c@@ lin@@ ed to hear it .
in this district , some preci@@ se and predic@@ tive de@@ tail is re@@ qui@@ red , and we have some :
the location of the car , the make and model , the description of the driver were all corrobor@@ ated on the scene .
yes , the erratic driving obser@@ ved was min@@ ima@@ l , but it did support the acc@@ ur@@ acy of the tip .
it 's a close call , but it goes to the prosecu@@ tion .
the su@@ pre@@ me court needs to se@@ ttle this once and for all .
but for now , the defendant 's motion to suppre@@ ss is den@@ i@@ ed .
i don 't think i ever told you why your father and i were so against mitch .
not honestly - mom .
i have to say this , ab@@ by. um , i fired charles , by the way .
we never found the ledger , but at least he 's gone .
i should say thank you , but what you did was re@@ ck@@ less .
you could have been hurt , or arrested , or i don 't know what .
but you didn 't even think about that .
and mitch is the same way. we knew that even then .
you needed someone who was going to re@@ stra@@ in those im@@ pu@@ l@@ ses , not ma@@ gni@@ fy and re@@ infor@@ ce them .
we were terri@@ fied of what was going to come of it .
and we were right. it has led to a lot of pain .
but clearly also to a lot of love .
i spent years trying to fi@@ ll the ho@@ le you left when i lost you .
so yes , it 's not easy for me to make room .
but i 'd like to .
just let yourself in , lou@@ . you see this ?
you wanna work for joey morolto ? that 's antonio cer@@ v@@ ino .
he took two in the head last night. we found him in a gar@@ ba@@ ge du@@ mp@@ ster .
he gave the morol@@ tos 40 years and joey killed him because he might be dis@@ loyal .
you don 't know morolto did this. yeah , you tell yourselves that .
you do your job , i 'll do mine ? " you killed him .
show some respect .
we lost a good man .
this family 's in m@@ our@@ ning .
look , i didn 't kill antonio .
that doesn 't mean i 'm not cap@@ able , understand ?
seems to me you got what you wanted .
now you can argue patrick was framed .
i don 't think a dead man would mind .
he 's not wrong , i mean , stra@@ te@@ gy @-@ wi@@ se. this helps us , right ?
yeah ...
i told joey that antonio came to see me and he said he doesn 't have permission , so ...
maybe that 's wh@@ y. hey , we didn 't do this .
i feel like i 'm going mad , ray .
i don 't wanna be me@@ lo@@ dra@@ ma@@ tic about this , but i think i 'm starting to lose my mind .
you just need a good night 's sleep .
you think ? absolutely , brother .
we 're du@@ e. you 'll see , things will start to turn around .
dad !
you 're home ? we 're home .
the following story is fic@@ tional and does not de@@ pic@@ t any ac@@ tu@@ al person or ev@@ ent .
my name is harold cl@@ ar@@ k. i want to talk to the president .
lying lan@@ ds you right here .
sma@@ ck da@@ b in front of me .
when it comes to lying , i 'm your man .
that makes dr. lightman very special .
so , since you dra@@ gged me away from my work ,
who can tell me what a lie is ?
when my mom te@@ lls my dad he 's not getting a big be@@ lly ?
yeah. right. we learn to lie from gro@@ wn @-@ ups .
they think you don 't notice , but you do .
most of the time lying is bad , right ?
even if you think you 're doing it for a good reason .
trust me , life 's a lot easier if you learn to tell the truth .
lightman is miserable .
what st@@ r@@ ings did you pull to get him to do this ?
i had e@@ mi@@ ly ask .
she tu@@ tors a couple of the kids .
thought i could turn our class problem into a tea@@ cha@@ ble moment .
that 'd be a help .
so , even if you 're just thinking of not telling me the truth ,
i 'll warn you. it 's pretty hard to keep a lie from me .
go on. go on , i d@@ are you .
e@@ h ? right. clyde the turtle .
which one of you stole clyde the turtle from miss angela 's classroom ? e@@ h ?
no ta@@ kers ?
all of you are innocent , are you ?
we need to talk .
all right. good. boys and girls ,
meet fbi agent ben@@ j@@ am@@ in re@@ ynolds .
oh , hey , kids , how ya doing ?
hi@@ . hey , agent ben .
we need to tal@@ k. fo@@ ster 's waiting .
you , too. come on .
all right .
oh , and by the way ,
whoever it is that stole clyde the turtle ,
the turtle 's - they 're like le@@ tt@@ u@@ ce ,
or is that tor@@ to@@ is@@ es ?
i 'm gonna work on that one .
take a look at this screen .
this guy parked right in front of the treasury department an@@ ne@@ x .
that 's like two blocks from here .
yeah .
how long 's he been there ?
little under 15 minutes .
anybody consider this might be a peace@@ ful pro@@ test ?
a crazy farmer named harold clark ...
is driving up to washington d. c
to blow you federal folks up .
he 's got his tractor and trailer p@@ acked
with enough explo@@ si@@ ves to blow up the whole town .
so not a peace@@ ful pro@@ test then ?
yeah. who 's the caller ?
we don 't know yet .
the call was rela@@ yed here ,
but the sub@@ scri@@ ber information didn 't conv@@ ey .
we 're waiting to re@@ tri@@ e@@ ve it now .
is there anything else to support
the fact that he actually has a bomb in there ?
that 's what we need you all for .
so the question at hand is ,
is the threat real or is it a ho@@ a@@ x ?
we need to get these kids out of here now .
no. we 're not doing that .
protoco@@ l is anyone within the bomb radius ...
sta@@ ys inside and away from ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or windows .
in situ@@ ations like these more people are killed
by flying gla@@ ss than the blast it@@ self .
pl@@ us , this guy , he may be waiting for people
to evacu@@ ate just so he can trigger it .
so , everyone - including those kids
is staying right here until we can figure this thing out .
i was hoping you were going to say that .
all right. i 've got us ta@@ pped into the burea@@ u 's camer@@ as .
all right. tight as you can .
ti@@ gh@@ ter .
all right. come on , come on .
so , what do we know about this man ?
it 's like the caller said , the guy 's name is harold clark .
he ha@@ s@@ --@@ well , he had a family farm ...
right outside fre@@ der@@ ic@@ k@@ s@@ bur@@ g , virginia .
but it 's now in fore@@ clo@@ sure .
he definitely seems ag@@ it@@ ated .
no , he 's an@@ xious .
yeah , which i might be if the president didn 't take my call .
oh , come on. you know that 's not gonna happen .
no , what i 'm saying is i 'm not seeing mad bomber an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty here .
do you have any of your agents going on to this guy 's farm ?
yeah , from the ri@@ ch@@ mon@@ d office .
where 's torres ?
do you think she 's ready to handle this on her own ?
no , but we seem to be under lo@@ ck@@ down here ,
so i 'm willing to lo@@ wer the bar@@ . where is she ?
helping set up her cou@@ s@@ in 's qu@@ in@@ ce@@ an@@ er@@ a .
a@@ h. well , hold the ca@@ ke .
let 's send her down to the farm@@ house .
let 's see what his family thinks of this little fi@@ e@@ ld trip .
what about the kids ?
i 'm all over it .
ok , you guys , let 's go. qui@@ e@@ tly .
wait. come here , you .
hand it over .
yeah. nice try , son .
that 's how i got it .
we need you all in the con@@ ference room , ok ?
why ?
because it 's a@@ wesome .
come on .
go after him. go on .
let 's go .
is something wrong ?
we have a bit of a situation .
we just need you all away from ... any windows .
hey , 8 third @-@ gra@@ ders
in a room with no to@@ ys and no pupp@@ ies ?
it 's going to be chaos .
yeah. speaking of pupp@@ ies ,
you like kids , don 't you ?
no .
ok .
boys and girls , this is crazy uncle loker .
he 's going to be continu@@ ing our e@@ du@@ cation on lying .
for how long ?
as long as it takes .
hey .
torres is en rou@@ te .
oh. this is my boss , a@@ sa@@ c st@@ ee@@ le .
dr. cal lightman .
yo@@ . st@@ ee@@ le. thanks for letting us set up here .
all right , my office ,
my science you 're obviously after .
it 's under my com@@ man@@ d. ok ?
where are we doing this ?
i have some information you need to hear .
all right .
op@@ tical che@@ mi@@ cal sen@@ sor@@ s are picking up traces
of am@@ mon@@ i@@ um nit@@ rates and di@@ e@@ se@@ l fu@@ el from the trailer .
aren 't those pretty stan@@ d@@ ard far@@ my@@ ard sme@@ lls ?
yes , but he could also have an an@@ f@@ o bomb big enough
to take out several blocks of down@@ town d. c .
right .
coll@@ at@@ er@@ al damage @-@ wise , there 's a pretty strong case here for death by sniper , wouldn 't you say ?
i mean , you only need to be 30 % sure he 's got a bomb ,
then just kill him , taking one human life
by saving thous@@ an@@ ds of others ...
including those kids in there .
you 're the ex@@ per@@ t. that 's the call you 're going to have to make .
what ? do i look like an fbi puppet to you ?
your offic@@ es , your command , you 're the one who said that .
yeah , i did say that .
all right. no , thanks .
come on , look , look , look .
my boss is a really good guy , ok ?
but he 's not e@@ qui@@ pped to figure this thing out the you are .
so , come on , man. we need to know .
does that guy have a bomb in a trailer or not ?
all right .
all right. well , if i 'm going to do this ,
i 'll need to deal with him personally ,
so can you put me through ?
no no no. we have our own negoti@@ ators .
bomb@@ ers have a me@@ ssi@@ ah comple@@ x so ...
yeah , yeah , yeah. avoid discus@@ sion of the bomber 's pre@@ sent cri@@ sis in order to pre@@ v@@ ent him from ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing his god @-@ like power to destroy and kill ...
yeah. i w@@ ro@@ te that bit in the man@@ ual .
is that true ?
well , when you 're ready ...
all right .
hello .
harold , i 'm cal lightman .
do you have the president with you ?
no , no , not right now ,
but i 'm calling at his re@@ quest .
call me back when you got him .
what do i know ?
yes ? mary clark ?
who are you ?
may we come inside , ma 'am ?
my friends are here .
oh , this won 't take long .
we are live outside the treasury department an@@ ne@@ x
in nor@@ th@@ we@@ st washington d. c .
where a dis@@ g@@ run@@ t@@ led ...
has harold ever talked about taking action against the go@@ vernment ?
mrs. clark ?
he compla@@ ined , you know , like everyone else about tax@@ es and the econom@@ y .
i just , uh ... i can 't believe he 's up there in damn d. c .
with his tractor .
so you did not know that he was going to go do this today ?
no. no .
he talked about , um ...
maybe going up there with a me@@ ga@@ phone .
and , uh , calling out them ba@@ star@@ ds
in the treasury department , but not this .
it sounds like harold 's pretty angry .
you 're damn right he 's pi@@ ssed .
they took his family farm .
three gener@@ ations , they had it .
ma 'am , it 's not a huge lea@@ p from anger to viol@@ ence .
does he have a bomb in that trailer he to@@ wed ?
you listen to me - harold and i have been together since so@@ pho@@ more year in high school .
i know this man .
he would never hurt anyone .
you didn 't answer the question , ma 'am .
no , he doesn 't have a damn bomb .
he just ...
he just wants to talk to the president .
you don 't believe that .
otherwise , you wouldn 't have fear all over your face .
i 'm not afraid of what he 's going to do .
i 'm afraid of what you all are going to do to him .
so , unless you have a search warrant to be here ,
i 'd really like it if you 'd leave my home .
i can get a warrant in 10 minutes .
then get it .
rea@@ ding emo@@ tions helps us dis@@ cover lies .
who wants to tell me what emo@@ tion this person is feeling ?
this one and that one .
con@@ temp@@ t .
i don 't think they know what that is .
is this really science ? it seems dumb .
we were supposed to leave half an h@@ our ago .
why are we still here ?
now 's when we have music class .
yeah .
isn 't this better than music class ?
no .
dr. cal !
they want to know why they 're here instead of back in music class ,
which is where they norma@@ lly are at this time .
it 's my fault .
i told your bus driver to go and pick up a couple of friends of mine at the airport .
and the plane was late , so he 's stuck there ,
waiting for them. sorry about that .
are you allowed to do that ?
yeah , i got permission from your princi@@ pal .
you know , someone in here is definitely lying
about clyde the turt@@ le. i can smell it .
loker , get your guitar , enter@@ tain the tr@@ oo@@ ps .
oh , it 's tor@@ res. hey .
i spoke to harold 's wife .
she 's definitely hiding something .
did you ask her about the bomb ?
yeah , but she doesn 't believe he has one .
who ever heard of a husband keeping secre@@ ts from his wife ?
the only thing i know for sure is she doesn 't believe he 's violent .
hello ?
harold , i 've got a question for you .
call me when you 're ready to let me speak with the president .
yeah , well , he wants to know what you want to talk about .
is it g@@ lo@@ ba@@ l war@@ ming ? death pen@@ alty ? what ?
i want to talk about our ta@@ x money being sent over@@ sea@@ s ,
or ba@@ iling out ban@@ ks ,
but letting our farm@@ ers cho@@ ke on their own cro@@ ps .
somebody 's got to stand up and say something .
all right. well , i 'll pass that on .
in the meantime , could you answer a question for me ?
yeah , what is it ?
all right .
what kind of bomb are we talking about ?
what ?
well , there 's a ru@@ mor going on around here that you 're sitting on a bomb .
is this you trying to change the sub@@ je@@ ct ?
no , no , we spoke to your wi@@ fe. she was a little off .
i want the president .
let me re@@ play that .
what ?
when you asked him if he had a bomb ,
the left side of his li@@ p ti@@ ght@@ en@@ ed .
it 's con@@ temp@@ t .
he 's being de@@ cep@@ tive .
so you 're giving us the green light .
what is it with you people ?
why is it always red light , green light ?
what do you want me to do ?
pull the trigger for you ?
wait , wait , let me explain something to you .
i 'm trying to save innocent lives here , your inclu@@ ded .
all right ? there are no easy choices here .
so let 's all act like gro@@ wn @-@ ups ,
make the hard choices , and sal@@ v@@ age what we can .
right .
well , what i 'm telling you is that he 's being
de@@ cep@@ tive in his den@@ ial of having a bomb .
i don 't know yet what that means exactly .
it 's good enough for me .
do it and i 'll pre@@ p the sni@@ pers .
all right. so once you 're in place ,
con@@ c@@ ea@@ led , and on tar@@ get , sound off .
let 's follow all protoco@@ ls on this .
no happy tri@@ gg@@ ers .
ro@@ ger that , sir .
do you guys have to do this in the lo@@ bby ?
we 've got a bunch of kids here we 've man@@ ag@@ ed to keep in the dark so far .
until i give the word ,
you are not authori@@ zed to shoot ...
unless someone 's in im@@ medi@@ ate dang@@ er. you got that ?
we 'll be waiting for your green light .
then get going .
yes , sir !
a little m@@ ood lighting ?
yeah , the ba@@ ll@@ a@@ sts on the flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ent lights
interferes with our video and en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted radio comm@@ uni@@ cations .
all right , we 're good to go .
now you 've got some semb@@ l@@ ance of a ra@@ pp@@ ort with harold .
keep him dist@@ racted while the sni@@ pers move in , ok ?
oh , that 's nice .
remind me to ren@@ e@@ goti@@ ate my contr@@ act with you .
we appreciate what you 're doing , doctor .
yes , i know you do .
hello ?
har@@ ol@@ d. me again .
i spoke with the president 's office .
when can i talk to him ?
well , you need to promise me
that no one 's going to get hurt here .
i don 't want anybody to get hurt .
that was genuine .
so i 'll work with that or i 'm done here , all right ?
i believe you when you say that ,
but i don 't think that you 're telling me the whole truth about the bomb .
quit sta@@ lling .
did you tell the president what i wanted to talk about ?
yeah , i di@@ d. i told him .
but he wants to know what it is that you want him to do .
i 'll tell him on the phone .
is your wife involved in this ?
no , no , this is all me .
quit playing games .
right .
ok@@ . sea@@ ts 4 , we 're going to have a concert .
ok .
hey .
how dangerous is it out there ?
how dangerous is it in here ?
i don 't know .
but i trust lightman ,
and it 's my job to keep these kids from freaking out .
what if their tea@@ ch@@ er is frea@@ ked out ?
well , i 'll help her , too ...
but you 've got to help me with them first , ok ?
ok .
ok .
who knows the words to " pu@@ ff , the magic dra@@ g@@ on " ?
my mom said that song 's about ill@@ e@@ gal drugs .
i don 't think that 's ever been defin@@ i@@ tiv@@ ely proven .
all sniper teams in position .
all right. co@@ py that .
you can go ahead and try and engage him .
we 're ready .
you have the president ?
all right , harold , a little rea@@ lity check here .
your situation is ve@@ ering from bad to worse by the minute .
i 'm getting cold , and i 'm getting angry .
i don 't want to talk to you anymore .
well , that 's unfortun@@ ate ,
because i 'm the only person here
who has any desi@@ re to talk to you .
i just want to talk to the president .
well , let 's start with the truth then .
what kind of bomb are we talking about here ?
the bomb is ri@@ gged .
how ?
it just is , ok ?
if you do anything to me ,
you try to hurt me , the bomb goes off .
and if i don 't speak directly to the president before the su@@ n goes down ,
the bomb goes off !
look , man , all that can be avo@@ i@@ ded ...
if you just have the president call me .
is he telling the truth ?
yeah .
yeah , i believe he is .
but he 's also showing fear .
all right , it 's the kind of fear that you get when someone 's got a gun to your head .
believe me , i 've seen that .
you know what , z@@ oo@@ m into that tractor seat .
go ahead .
yeah. lo@@ wer .
lo@@ wer@@ . right , keep going ...
right ther ...
oh , god .
we didn 't see it before because his jack@@ et was in the way .
sniper one to ba@@ se .
all sniper teams in posi@@ tion. we 're waiting for green light .
just hold your position , sniper team .
you are not clea@@ red to fi@@ re. stand down .
sniper one is clear .
standing down .
if this guy has a deton@@ ator switch on his seat ...
and if we fire , that might deton@@ ate the bomb .
let 's use an l@@ v@@ b water dis@@ rup@@ ter .
is that what i think it is ?
it 's a bomb we bring in to kill his bomb .
oh , this is just getting better and better , this is .
i found something on the 911 call you should hear .
a crazy farmer named harold clark is driving up to washington d. c .
to blow you federal folks up .
one more time .
a crazy farmer named harold clark is driving up to washington d. c .
to blow you federal folks up .
all right , just that last little bit .
blow you federal folks up .
do you hear it ?
yeah , he 's smiling .
what ?
the in@@ fle@@ ction of his voice changes ...
because a smile changes the sound of your voice
by sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ing the voice re@@ son@@ ance cha@@ mber .
he 's smiling as he says " blow you federal folks up " .
wait , you can tell someone 's smiling just by listening to him ?
you can 't. we can .
he know something you don 't and he 's laugh@@ ing at you .
so what is this , a prac@@ tical jo@@ ke ?
no , i think he 's telling the truth .
he finds some kind of sick humor in this .
he may be connected to this .
yeah .
harold is not working on his own .
we need to find this guy quick .
no , i get it , i do .
you 're looking for someone to blame in case this thing goes south , right ?
that 's why you set up your command center in my office , effe@@ c@@ tiv@@ ely putting my finger on the trigger .
well , what do you say we make sure before you just go ahead and kill him ?
are you done ?
because con@@ st@@ itu@@ tion@@ ally speaking ,
you don 't have to be right to use dea@@ dly force ,
we just have to be reason@@ ab@@ ly sure .
and in a world full of bomb@@ s and l@@ un@@ a@@ tics ...
sometimes there 's no room for sci@@ en@@ tifi@@ c certain@@ ty .
you know , you 're so scared of making a huge mistake ,
you 're prepared to make a sma@@ ller ,
yet poten@@ tially still tra@@ gic one .
you want this to end peace@@ fully ?
you give me proof and allow me to do that .
all right. the 911 caller was just id 'd as ron jackson .
white male , 3@@ 8 , lives near harold in virginia .
boss , we 've got time .
we should get torres and one of your agents over there right now .
yeah .
in this situation sta@@ lling and not making a decision
is the same thing as making one .
well , i want to be certain of the truth when i make my decision .
well , you better make it soon ...
because the clock is ti@@ cking on that bomb .
bomb ? what bomb ?
he had to go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
you 're a big kid , right ?
you 're not going to turn into one of them ...
wh@@ in@@ y little c@@ ry babies , are you ?
right. no ?
all right .
here 's the truth .
all right ?
not far from here there 's a man who says he 's got a bomb .
he 's trying to get some people 's attention .
now , maybe he has and maybe he 's lying .
but , in the meantime , you and your ma@@ tes ,
you 're going to stay here , just to be on the safe side .
you got it ? all right .
now , it 's my job to find out what 's what with this maybe @-@ maybe not bomb type thing ,
and i 'm exce@@ llent at my job .
just ask loker here .
and it 's your job to be a top @-@ no@@ t@@ ch third @-@ gra@@ der .
you up for it ?
you up for keeping this a secret from your ma@@ tes ...
so that they don 't get all , you know , scar@@ e@@ dy c@@ at on you ?
good. all right .
well , go pe@@ e then .
excuse me .
what c@@ tan i do for you ?
i 'm looking for ron jackson .
is he your husband ?
don 't remind me .
wait , ma 'am .
fbi .
where is he , ma 'am ?
we need to talk to him .
sorry , i thought y '@@ all were bi@@ ll colle@@ c@@ tors .
where 's your husband , ma 'am ?
honestly , i got no idea .
what 's he done now ?
you know a man named harold clark ?
yeah .
i guess everyone knows harold now .
how do you know him ?
him and ron run a farm@@ ers ' co @-@ op .
they mostly get together , drink , and bitch about things .
all right we take a look around , ma 'am ?
yeah , we ain 't got no@@ thin ' to hide .
bla@@ sting ca@@ ps for bomb@@ s .
all right , look , just hear me out , ok ?
maybe jackson was an accompli@@ ce ,
but he got cold feet , decided to call 911 ,
and give up the whole p@@ lot .
that doesn 't explain the smile behind his voice .
what is that ?
oh , that .
that 's how these boys plan to win this .
it doesn 't look like much , but ...
here 's the deal , ok ?
we 're going to place that contain@@ er of water near harold 's bomb .
there 's a large qu@@ anti@@ ty of c @-@ 4
in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the contain@@ er ,
which we will then deton@@ ate ,
sending the water out at 7@@ 2 million p@@ si .
it will dis@@ rupt harold 's bomb before it can explo@@ de .
and harold 's bir@@ d@@ fe@@ ed .
he won 't even know what hit him .
oh , this is going to be fun .
what the hell is that thing coming towards me ?
it 's an x @-@ ray machine , harold .
we needed to ma@@ p the bomb ...
so we can figure out a safe evacu@@ ation plan .
tell me about ron jackson .
you know about ron ?
yep .
better still , why don 't you tell me ...
how to dis@@ able the bomb so nobody gets hurt .
i don 't - i don 't know how to stop it .
it 's not my bomb .
whose is it ?
is it jackson 's ?
is he pulling the st@@ r@@ ings ?
i shouldn 't even be talking to you .
he 'll kill her if i tell you guys anything .
kill who ?
look , you might as well tell me .
it 's just us on the phone , all right ?
i mean ... you 're already in a very bad spot .
you do know that , don 't you ?
they have someone in my house with my wife .
they 're going to kill her if i don 't go through with this .
i don 't know what else to do .
he 's telling the truth .
the washington me@@ t@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan police department ...
torres .
hey , it 's us. are you at the clu@@ b@@ house ?
yeah , i 'm working here .
where 's agent irving ?
um , he 's doing the search of the bar .
mar@@ ia , give very simp@@ le ans@@ wers ...
and don 't let anyone think ...
what you 're saying is important .
ok .
is there a man there named da@@ ve miller ?
he would 've been there all day .
yeah .
all right , i 'm going to call irving and tell him to get in there .
this man is probably armed and he 's willing to kill .
wo@@ w. i did not know that .
he 's there as a threat against the wife
to force harold to go through with this .
that would certainly explain
the fear you saw earlier .
ok , well , that sounds fun .
ho@@ pe@@ fully , i can get tick@@ ets .
re@@ ynolds has been on with agent irving .
he 's on his way. just sit tight , all right ?
cool. let me know how it goes .
shouldn 't be more than a few minutes .
we 'll get out of here .
what were they saying about harold ?
find out what kind of bomb it is ?
no , no .
but i do have some bad news .
i don 't think they 're going to let harold talk to the president .
probably not .
but i think i have a solution
to this whole thing and you two know him well ,
obviously , so let me just run it by you .
i have a friend who works in as@@ semb@@ ly@@ man kin@@ ca@@ id 's office .
maybe i call in a fa@@ vor and he can talk to harold .
that 's , uh - that 's not really the same thing .
but at least it 's a phone call with someone who works in the go@@ vernment .
lady , quit wasting our time .
that 's kind of the point , actually .
put your hands over your head .
people lie all the time .
it must make you pretty c@@ y@@ ni@@ cal .
sometimes , but you get to see the truth occasionally .
truth is , i 'm really scared right now .
i know .
me , too .
well , a little bit .
i just ... i want another chance , you know ?
i 'd do things different .
is that a stupid thing to say ?
no , not at all .
oscar 's acting weird .
oscar , you ok ?
hey .
you know , when i was your age ,
i had a crush on this girl@@ --@@ older woman , really
si@@ xth gra@@ der .
i was always worrying about it , stre@@ ssing out about it ,
and then i reali@@ zed there was nothing you can do .
so , sometimes , when there 's nothing you can do ,
you just have to believe everything is gonna be ok .
and you write a song .
can 't be worried and write a song at the same time , right ?
i mean , you look to me like a guy who can write some fanta@@ sti@@ c r@@ hy@@ mes .
am i right ?
yep , i can tell that about you .
i can see it on your face .
so , let 's give it a shot .
your wife and your son are safe , harold .
thank you .
tell me about jackson .
i don 't know .
he just put me in this tractor and he told me to drive here .
he said if i got out of the seat , it would trigger the bomb .
and he didn 't mention any other plan to you .
no , nothing .
i mean , i knew that he was even ang@@ ri@@ er than i was .
but i never thought in a million years he would ...
i 'm a dead man .
can i speak to my wife ?
yeah , yeah , i 'll work on that for you .
sit tight , harold , all right ?
i 'll get back to you .
you have to call off the dis@@ rup@@ ter charge
until we can figure out what 's going on .
harold is just a pawn .
the ir@@ a used to do the same thing .
they 'd co@@ erce civili@@ ans to do the work for ' em .
there 's nothing we can do for him now .
he 's still sitting on a bomb we can 't def@@ use .
hey , look , if he mo@@ ves , call me back .
jackson just turned his phone on .
we tri@@ an@@ gu@@ lated it to 1@@ 5th and i street .
hey , that is right here ,
just outside the blast radius .
that 's also near the hotel
where secretary do@@ b@@ b@@ ins is holding his econom@@ ic summ@@ it .
ok , jackson 's cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d was used to rent a white box van 4 hours ago .
all right , i 'm headed over there now .
remind me what this guy looks like ?
let 's get that out to all units .
yeah , but he 's not gonna look like that , is he ?
i mean , he 's probably gonna be dis@@ gui@@ sed or something .
you need to look for the po@@ stu@@ re ，
and the ga@@ ze of a terrorist .
why am i telling you this ?
why don 't you just come with me ?
take a look at that - white box van , no pla@@ tes .
suspension 's ma@@ xed out .
yeah .
so the terrorists have their own delivery vehicle .
this takes me back .
he 's probably gonna want to hide in plain sight
could be in that crowd over there .
yeah , so he can keep an eye on his van .
yeah , on the tar@@ get .
you know how it is .
what happens if we spot him ?
that 's the sig@@ nal .
all right .
yeah , give me the bomb squad .
hey , jackson .
we 've got harold 's wife and son .
they 're safe .
you got the wrong guy , pal .
no , no. you 're ron jackson , right ?
you 've got a bomb in that van back there , don 't ya ?
answer me .
what about harold 's trailer ?
is that just a de@@ co@@ y ?
answer me !
i know that 's the trigger .
jackson , put the phone down !
put it down !
fbi ! f@@ bi@@ . fbi .
all right , so you 're all offic@@ i@@ ally song wri@@ ters now .
nice work , and i want to thank oscar for these great ly@@ ri@@ cs .
my pleasure .
all right , here we go .
and , um , sing your part .
help me out , all right ?
good .
here you go .
good work .
command po@@ st .
sir , we 've got jackson and the bomb .
it 's over .
things are about to get wrapped up here , too .
did you get ho@@ ward out of the tractor yet ?
i can 't risk the lives of my bomb tech@@ s on this .
there 's no telling how many boo@@ by tra@@ ps there are in harold 's device .
boss , listen
look , ben , you did a great job , ok ?
but we 're pro@@ c@@ ee@@ d@@ ing. i 'm sorry .
if there are other con@@ spira@@ tors out there ,
they find out jackson 's dead ,
they 'll push the button on harold 's bomb .
hey , when i asked jackson about harold 's bomb ,
he was defen@@ si@@ ve. he was blu@@ ff@@ ing .
can you tell me with 100 % certain@@ ty ...
that there 's no bomb on harold clark 's trailer ?
not ye@@ t. give me time .
we 're out of time .
hello ?
harold , we 've got jackson and miller ,
and we took care of jackson 's bomb .
how 's my family ?
they 're doing fine .
thank you for saving them .
i can 't take cre@@ d@@ it for that , but i 'll pass on your thanks .
the fbi still thinks you have a bomb in your trailer ,
and they want to dis@@ rupt you with an explo@@ sive device
that could kill you in the proce@@ ss. uh ...
i understand .
harold , did you ever see the bomb ?
or were you just told about a dead man switch ?
i heard the cli@@ ck of the switch .
i never saw the bomb .
ron said that he would call and tell me how
to diff@@ use it if i just sta@@ lled you guys long enough .
that 's not good enough .
yeah , no , i get it .
look , they should go ahead and do it , just to be sure .
there are too many people around here , and if there ...
is a bomb in my trailer ...
i 'd rather die than live knowing i may have killed other people .
yeah , we 're not there yet .
please , just let me talk to my wife before they do it , though .
please ? so i can just say good @-@ bye ?
honey , i hope you can for@@ give me .
what are you talking about ?
i love you .
i have always loved you .
and i want you to ...
i want you to give bobby a big hu@@ g for me .
i want you to tell him that i am sorry .
i 've always been very proud to have you as a husband , harold .
let 's do it .
you know , you should leave if you don 't want to see this .
it 's about bloo@@ dy time , torres .
i got it. it should be ready to pull up .
all right .
and ?
i think you 're right .
is there a bomb in harold 's trailer ?
yes , there is .
why should i believe you ?
ron wanted to kill the secretary of treasury ...
and all those money men when they evacu@@ ated .
even if that didn 't work ,
he was going to have harold 's bomb blow just to get the message across .
so , yeah , harold 's got a bomb , all right .
i mean , you see that , right ?
i see it .
right , he 's lying through his te@@ e@@ th .
i mean , their only hope of coll@@ at@@ er@@ al damage
is if the fbi blo@@ ws harold up for ' em .
i mean , you 're the puppet now .
no. i can 't take that chance .
well , i bloo@@ dy can@@ . i 'm going to see harold .
boss , i 'm going to have to go with lightman on this one .
i said no. i can 't allow it .
look , you asked me to make the call , right ?
well , now , i 'm making it .
there is no bomb in that trailer .
if you 're wrong , it 's your ass .
well , if i 'm wrong , in 5 minutes , i won 't have an ass , will i ?
are you telling me you 're 100 % sure ?
yes .
but ... i 'd clear the ar@@ e@@ a , you know ?
just in case i 'm wrong .
hey , harold .
hey , how ya do@@ in ' ?
i 'm cal light@@ man. we spoke on the phone earlier .
you 're safe now. you can come on down .
are you out of your mind ?
no , not right now , but , in a couple of hours ,
i 'm gonna be really very drunk .
well , what about the bomb ?
there is no bomb@@ . it 's safe .
there 's a bomb@@ . i heard a cli@@ ck .
harold , this is probably your one and only chance to walk away from this .
so , if i were you , i 'd definitely step on down .
careful .
here , let me give you a hand .
you 're all right .
there ya go .
all right .
don 't go near that one because that one is a bomb .
what are you doing ?
hang on a minute .
good work .
nice work .
no ? ok .
i 'm the one who stole clyde .
oh , i know .
he 's a turtle and he doesn 't like being in the classroom at night all by himself .
i took him home so he wouldn 't be lonely .
ok .
you know , i think that clyde probably likes being on his own at night .
i think he enjo@@ ys the quiet .
i say you bring him back into school tomorrow , all right ?
to the classroom .
but you sn@@ ea@@ k him back in .
no one needs to know a thing .
i think i should tell miss angela .
really ?
oh , good girl .
i might have a job for you one day .
all yours .
get out of here. don 't miss your bus .
go on , you guys. i 'll be right there .
i hope you guy had fun - bye . - bye .
well , there 's a first time for everything .
you all right ?
um , anyone want a drink ? hmm ?
absolutely - yes , please .
sha@@ des of gary , n@@ en@@ net house , co@@ st@@ a ver@@ de , california - you .
hey , barbie .
i got a message from someone named rebel ?
said you could help me .
i need your help , barbie .
rebel promised .
well , he lied .
now get out .
please .
i can 't go back out there .
claire ? you okay ?
oh , my god .
mom@@ . it 's all right .
mr. doyle here was just leaving .
no , please .
they 'll catch me .
rebel said you could help me start over ,
and that 's all i want
to go back to being a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er ,
making people happy .
and you thought i would help you ?
after what you did ?
you should know there are agents parked outside this house .
actually , they 're not .
rebel set a fa@@ ke call ,
which they 'll figure out any minute now .
but if there were agents outside ...
why aren 't they kicking in the door ,
looking to collect a comes @-@ back @-@ to @-@ life barbie ?
they gave me a free pass ,
but they will come after me if i try to help anyone .
so you turn your back on your own kind ,
while we 're all out there being hun@@ ted down ?
they burned down my thea@@ ter while i was still inside .
and you tried to kill us , you-- !
you and your free pass .
you have no idea what it 's like
to be hun@@ ted ,
to live on the street ,
to break into the home of the last person on earth
you 'd expect to help you .
because she was your only hope .
i thought ...
well ...
i 'm not gonna force you to help me , claire .
that 's not who i am anymore .
where the hell have you been ?
dealing with the mess your brother left us .
there wouldn 't have been a mess if you 'd released parkman and mi@@ ll@@ br@@ ook
like i asked you to .
i made the right cho@@ ic@@ e. peter just got lucky .
though i have won@@ dered
how many people knew he was on that roof@@ top .
petrelli .
what ?
yeah , i 'm on my way .
i thought parkman was in your custody .
he was last time i checked .
well , what the hell is he doing in front of the cap@@ it@@ o@@ l building
with a bomb stra@@ pped to his chest ?
no , no , no .
no , no .
dea@@ c@@ tiv@@ ate the device now ,
then lie face down .
i don 't know if i try and pull this it 's going ...
i didn 't do this. i was set up !
senator nathan petrelli .
sir , this is a very dangerous situ@@ a@@ tion. i can 't
lieutenant , i know that man .
i can get through to him .
you got five minutes .
parkman !
you son of a bitch .
don 't you come any closer to me .
it 's gonna be all right . - no , it 's not !
you turned me into a terrorist .
i didn 't san@@ ction this. that was danko .
you 're lying to me ! - he 's got an agen@@ d@@ a .
you 're lying to me ! - believe me , matt .
use your power@@ . read my mind .
i 'm telling you the truth .
i can 't. i can 't. they dru@@ gged me .
gonna have to trust me , matt .
parkman 's vest is ready , sir , but we have a problem here .
petre@@ lli@@ . how 'd he get there so fast ?
is the device armed ?
we 're all set .
senator wants to play hero ...
he can be a mar@@ ty@@ r to his own cause .
take them out .
code confirmed , sir . - do it .
take him out. now .
i don 't know where this came from !
i 'm gonna blow up !
we 've been kicked out .
get it back. now .
... though there are those who believe
that he may know the bomber personally .
what 's going on here ?
come on. we 're lo@@ s@@ in ' our window .
i 'm rou@@ ting through a different ser@@ ver .
matt , if we don 't dis@@ arm you , they 're gonna shoot you .
there are a lot of bomb tech@@ s around here .
i 'm sure one of them
is thinking about how to dis@@ arm that .
get inside his head .
the drugs are starting to wear off , but i don 't think
what 's he thinking ?
running out of time .
red wire .
red wire. red wire . - red wire .
doesn 't make any sense .
why would a su@@ icide bomber bo@@ ther with du@@ mmy wire ?
don 't touch the red wire . - i 'm not tou@@ ching anything .
we have to take the shot !
just hang on .
it 's all right , matt , take your time .
black wire is the key .
black wire. black wire . - black wire. okay .
do i pull the black wire ,
or is that the one i don 't pull ?
he 's not thinking directly about it .
i gotta dig dee@@ per@@ . hold on !
i got it. we 're back up .
weapon armed , sir .
senator ! - matt , i 'm gonna pull it .
all right , do it . - danko .
i said do it .
wait !
damn it !
sorry , matt .
i can 't have you us@@ in ' your power .
it 's open . [ cou@@ gh@@ s ]
almost got the order ready .
you have a lot of pic@@ k@@ ups today ?
i 'm not here for a pic@@ k@@ up .
no ?
it 's me .
gabriel .
your son .
is that so ?
that is so .
what brings you all the way out here ?
i had some questions about myself ...
who i am ,
where i came from .
but then i remembered .
you abandoned me .
you killed my mother .
so ?
what now ?
now ?
i kill you .
go right ahead .
you kill me , or the cancer does .
either way , i die .
i haven 't got all day .
anything ?
this guy 's good .
there 's no sign the system was even brea@@ ched .
i wanna know how the hell he 's getting inside , and i want a name .
me too .
so we can thank them
for saving us from this disa@@ ster .
of course ,
since the safety of your friends and family
evi@@ den@@ tly tru@@ mp@@ s national security .
parkman wasn 't a threat 。
until you stra@@ pped a bomb to him .
parkman and your brother ex@@ po@@ sed our oper@@ ations ,
so i handled it ,
put a face to the terrorist threat .
people could have died .
people have died , senator , or don 't my men count ?
i was brought in to get this job done .
i 'd let go of that if i were you .
you 're re@@ liev@@ ed of command .
i answer to the president .
you try to get rid of me , he 's gonna want proof ,
and right now it 's my word against yours .
good luck getting any of my people to turn on me .
we 'll se@@ e. excuse me .
ben@@ net , you have a minute ?
i 'm not sure how much i can tell ya about what happened - i know what happened last night .
i wanna talk to you about putting a team together
once danko 's gone .
you 're gonna head up our ... - you 're one of us , nathan .
you 're one of us !
you 're one of us , nathan .
you 're one of us ! - do you have a point ?
that maybe this oper@@ ation
has been com@@ promised from the start .
the petrelli family has a lot of sk@@ ele@@ t@@ ons
in their clo@@ set , senator .
i think we both know what yours is .
so ... looks like we 're both building a case
against each other .
let 's see who gets there first .
you 're one of us , nathan .
you 're one of us !
help is coming , have hope - son of a bitch went over my head .
you b@@ acked a wi@@ ld dog into a cor@@ n@@ er. what do you expect ?
i had to act . - but you didn 't act .
all you did was show danko your hand ,
and , fran@@ k@@ ly , you put both of us at risk .
i had a plan , though .
nathan , listen to me .
he 's pushing your butt@@ ons
so that you 'll make a mistake .
take a play from your mother 's book .
keep your head .
sorry about all this .
i find that hard to believe .
the man who trans@@ ferred you back here
is gonna come in in a few moments
and ask you some questions .
i was wondering when that was gonna happen .
i know this might seem hard to believe ,
but i still care about you . - well , that makes one of us .
come on. you 're smarter than that .
you might not realize it ,
but i have been helping you out all along .
you and everyone else .
and doing a fa@@ bu@@ l@@ ous job of it .
you remember when you ju@@ mped off the bri@@ dge and i was there ?
i 'm still the same guy .
you s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed me for your own personal ga@@ in .
you don 't have to like me ,
but you do have to understand that i am your last hope .
that 's my prison@@ er .
got a so@@ ft spot for this one , petrelli ?
wanna make sure i don 't get too rough with her ?
no , no. knock yourself out .
i wanna know everything you know about nathan petrelli .
he was l@@ ous@@ y in bed .
i wanna know what you meant
when you said he was " one of us .
does nathan have an ability ?
an ability ?
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
you wanna talk about it ?
should i have hel@@ ped doyle ?
that puppet man is a sick and twisted indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al , claire .
you did the right thing .
i have a free pass for a reason .
i should be using it to help people .
rebel seems to think so .
yes , well , this rebel , whoever he is ,
can 't send psycho@@ pa@@ ths to our front do@@ or@@ step .
i don 't think i can take any more surprise guests .
right , which is why i was thinking
that i should have a cover job .
i mean , with a@@ le@@ x gone ,
they 're probably gonna need someone to fi@@ ll his job
at the comic book store ,
and i could help whoever rebel sen@@ ds ,
and no more surprise guests for you and l@@ yle .
boy , claire , i don 't know .
i guess so .
if it 's what you want to do .
thanks .
so , you don 't have any re@@ tail experi@@ ence ?
um , does a cheer@@ lea@@ ding ba@@ ke sa@@ le count ?
uh , you 're a cheer@@ leader ?
yeah , i was .
all right , so let me as you a few questions .
can you work wednesdays ?
wednesdays ?
wednesdays are when all the new com@@ ics ar@@ ri@@ ve .
wednes@@ day is good for me .
f@@ light or in@@ vi@@ si@@ bi@@ lity ?
i 'm sorry. what ?
do you throw ca@@ u@@ tion to the wind
and fly off to save the day ,
or do you take the more ca@@ l@@ cu@@ lated app@@ ro@@ ac@@ h
and learn the whole picture before you act ?
what 's the answer ?
there isn 't one .
that 's why it 's the question .
put simply , what type of hero are you ?
i don 't know .
whoa , hey , hey .
you 're not gonna c@@ ry are you ?
it@@ --@@ it 's okay , really .
they 're only comic books , i mean ...
i 'm gonna stop bo@@ ther@@ ing you .
uh , thank you for letting me interview , anyway .
what are you talking about ? you got the job .
i did ?
every guy in the store 's been star@@ ing at you
since you walked in .
you will absolutely sell comic books ,
and the other stuff we can work on .
you 're still here .
this is pi@@ ti@@ ful .
what 's that ?
what you 've become .
you used to be a ki@@ ll@@ er. now look at you. you 're pa@@ the@@ tic .
oh. you want a fight .
is that what you were expecting ?
son kills his father ? e@@ pi@@ c ba@@ ttle ?
ah , that 's a myth .
no , life
life never gi@@ ves you what you want .
give me a hand with this .
maybe i can explain it to ya .
now , when i open the tra@@ p ,
he 's gonna bo@@ lt ,
so grab him from the back , all right ?
you have an ability .
got lots of ' em .
don 't know what i got left .
been years since i used ' em
or needed them .
you have the same thing
taking people 's ab@@ ilities .
am i right ?
guess the app@@ le didn 't fall too far from the t@@ ree .
i 'm not your app@@ le. you don 't know anything about me .
i have some idea .
you and i , we can 't be all that different .
from where i stand , we have exactly nothing in common .
yeah , well , we pick easy tar@@ gets .
like that r@@ ab@@ bit@@ --@@ weak , help@@ less .
not fair , really .
are you really dra@@ wing a mor@@ al line ?
mor@@ ality doesn 't figure into it .
fi@@ sh gotta swim , bir@@ ds gotta fly .
you have to ki@@ ll. it 's who you are .
but you do choose your prey ,
and yours never had a chance , not against you .
not really .
easy picking 's .
small game .
they had something i wanted .
it isn 't my fault
if they weren 't strong enough to fight back .
and those agents
that have been com@@ in ' after us recently ?
i handled them . - no , you ran away from ' em .
just like i did .
i could wipe them out with a thought .
but you haven 't .
why ?
you know , there 'll come a day ,
maybe tomorrow or next week , next year ,
when you realize the hunt ...
... your entire life ,
was mean@@ ing@@ less and disappoin@@ ting , ' cause there 's no challenge in it .
you know , all the power in the world doesn 't matter
if you 've lived an un@@ sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fied life .
and i think you know that already , don 't you ?
you wanna know more , or ...
you gonna kill me now ?
what do i do ?
gu@@ t him .
while you were at pri@@ ma@@ tech
did you come across anyone who could fly ?
pl@@ enty ,
but you know that .
it 's in the files .
i 'm guessing a few were missing .
the facility burned to the gr@@ ound .
who knows what was lost ?
that must have been tough for you .
20 years on the job .
i 'm sure you 've been close to the petrelli family .
the petrell@@ is were never exactly
a war@@ m and fuzzy bunch .
you a@@ do@@ p@@ ted the senator 's daughter .
i didn 't know she was his at the time ,
and neither did he , for that matter .
we both know nathan petrelli is hiding something .
you know what question you should be asking yourself ?
who would want to save peter ?
his mother ? angela ?
you wanna know what 's missing from the files ?
who can fly ?
she 'd never betray her own son .
a long time ago , i gave up trying to figure out
what angela petrelli would or wouldn 't do .
go ahead .
we 've got a problem .
nathan 's made a power play against danko .
he 's sti@@ r@@ red up a hor@@ net 's ne@@ st .
it 's nice to know a mother still has some in@@ flu@@ ence
over her son .
things will be better for us with danko gone .
of course they will , but nathan 's on thin ice .
he 's moving too fast , and danko 's un@@ predictable .
the man n@@ early killed peter .
it had to be done .
be prepared then , ' cause i poin@@ ted him in your direction .
be care@@ fu@@ l. he does his home@@ work .
so do i .
home@@ work .
thank you .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
claire .
you all right ? everything okay at home ?
yeah. that 's not what this is about .
i have a question ,
and i really need you to answer it .
okay .
how did you lead two lives for all that time ?
i can 't always be myself ,
and i just don 't know who i 'm supposed to be .
honestly , claire ,
i 'm the worst person to ask .
so how am i supposed to decide which pat@@ h to take ?
which answer do you want ?
do you want the one that 's gonna make you feel better ,
or do you want the truth ?
i don 't know .
well , then my answer is " neither do i " .
thanks .
i miss ya , claire bear .
doyle ! freeze !
put your hands over your head .
whatever you say .
when are you gonna learn ?
i have this effe@@ ct on women .
doyle , i 'm giving you a chance to sur@@ ren@@ der .
i should kill you ...
but i just wanna go back to the way life was .
all right , doyle .
barbie ?
mrs. petrelli .
my name is@@ -- mr. danko .
i was hoping you could help me .
well , everything i know about the people you 're after
is in the pri@@ ma@@ tech files .
i 'm not interested in files .
e@@ ll@@ e bi@@ shop , hi@@ r@@ o na@@ ka@@ mur@@ a , matt parkman ,
all in@@ her@@ ited ab@@ ilities from their par@@ ents ,
as did peter and claire .
well , gene@@ tics
is an ext@@ reme@@ ly comple@@ x to@@ pi@@ c , mr. danko .
did you know that two blue @-@ e@@ yed par@@ ents
can sometimes have a bro@@ wn @-@ e@@ yed child ?
so nathan ...
was the mis@@ f@@ it ?
sometimes these things s@@ ki@@ p a gener@@ ation .
i don 't believe you .
i 've met many men like you , mr. danko .
our company emp@@ loy@@ ed do@@ z@@ en@@ s of them
no family , nothing to hold you back .
you oper@@ ate in the sha@@ do@@ ws ,
doing all the awful things other people just re@@ f@@ use to do .
it 's what makes you us@@ e@@ ful .
and expen@@ d@@ able .
really ?
that incident in an@@ go@@ l@@ a ?
19@@ 9@@ 7 , i believe .
all those civili@@ ans lo@@ st. tra@@ gic .
i 'm surprised you survi@@ ved , actually .
you 're a very ... re@@ sour@@ ce@@ ful woman ,
mrs. petrelli .
a man needs a ho@@ bby ,
somethin ' to occu@@ py the hands ,
to stop the mind from thin@@ k@@ in ' so much .
i fi@@ x watches .
watches ?
thought it would make my father happy .
how 'd that work out for ya ?
you 're still c@@ lin@@ ging to that need for connection , huh ?
the only thing people are good for is disappoin@@ tment .
is that why you killed my mother ?
why you abandoned me ?
i don 't even remember .
didn 't matter to me .
so few things do .
well , now what ?
cut the th@@ read .
go on .
how 'd you do that ?
it 's just an ability i picked up
from a cheer@@ leader in california .
i guess not everybody gets old .
not everybody dies .
then you just have
that much longer to suff@@ er , don 't ya ?
get that. it needs to se@@ ttle .
over there on that ca@@ bin@@ et , if you don 't mind .
sure .
what the hell are you doing ?
it 's ama@@ zing how it comes right back ,
that desi@@ re , that hun@@ ger .
you think this is gonna stop me ?
you think you can beat me ?
i want that power !
i thought you 'd given up .
yeah , well , me too .
then why bo@@ ther ? what 's the point ?
immorta@@ li@@ t@@ y. you 're my second chance .
at what ? killing again ?
you said it was mean@@ ing@@ less .
it was .
then why make the same mistake twice ?
because i 'll get it right this time ,
do more , be more ,
take every challenge ,
fight hard , risk it all ,
take real power , real auth@@ or@@ ity ,
change every@@ thing@@ --@@ the world ,
just to see if i can .
you can move .
i can .
you 're the hun@@ ter .
i thought you would know
when someone was playing possu@@ m ,
when the prey isn 't so weak ,
so easy .
please ... i need that power .
i don 't wanna die .
> > no , no , no , of course not .
of course you don 't .
it won 't kill you if i take it .
you 'll hea@@ l. you 'll be fine .
yeah , but so will you .
no. don 't ... leave .
like i said , i came here to kill you .
i got the ans@@ wers i wanted .
now i know exactly what i need to do .
kill me .
oh , you 're gonna die .
s@@ low@@ ly ... pa@@ in@@ fully ...
and alone with your si@@ ck@@ ness .
please ...
don 't .
i 'm sorry .
you 're just small game .
turns out the president
didn 't really need that much proof after all .
it 's a signed do@@ cu@@ men@@ t. you 're finished .
you lose me , you lose the whole team .
well , that 's a risk i 'm prepared to take .
in fact , anyone who 's not on board
can step out now .
you 're hitting re@@ set on the whole oper@@ ation
just because of me ?
well , i think it 's time things were done corre@@ ctly .
you may have friends now , petrelli ,
but one day you 're gonna find yourself all alone .
you went to the president ?
mm @-@ hmm , and he is eager to meet danko 's replac@@ e@@ ment .
you com@@ in ' ?
they say you 're the man with the plan .
i sure hope you have something good
to sh@@ are with the president .
it 's a bit u@@ nor@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x , but it 's tested .
look , it 's over .
just let it go .
when are you gonna understand ?
burea@@ u@@ cr@@ acy , over@@ sight , rules of condu@@ ct ,
none of it app@@ lies in my world .
i don 't know what your world is ,
but it ought to be shut down .
danko , take it easy .
i 've seen what these people can do ,
and it scar@@ es me .
and the thing about you , senator ,
is that through all this ,
you 've never once shown an oun@@ ce of fear ,
and i wonder ...
why is that ?
i don 't have time for this .
tell me you didn 't know about this .
this is it@@ -- your new identi@@ ty ,
everything you need to start over .
rebel 's er@@ as@@ ed any trace of er@@ ic doyle .
you saw me sp@@ are that agent 's life .
is that it ?
have i ear@@ ned your help ?
this isn 't about you .
this is about me ,
about who i need to be right now ,
and i don 't ...
just take it .
thanks , barbie .
did you mean all that stuff you said
about how you 'd changed ?
finally .
i quit , and it takes the service
two hours to find a replac@@ e@@ ment ?
well , don 't just stand there .
come in. i 'm desp@@ er@@ ate .
excuse me , please .
we are looking for matt parkman .
anyway , he 's a mess .
here you go .
dia@@ per 's clean , but that won 't hold .
take it .
take it .
no , thank you .
now .
w@@ --@@ hey , wait .
we are here to save matt parkman .
uh @-@ hu@@ h. you 're holding him .
matt parkman ?
lots of lu@@ ck@@ . you 're gonna need it .
and by the way ,
this baby sitting service bit@@ es .
gener@@ ations un@@ f@@ old
father to son , mother to daughter .
where one leaves off , the other follows ,
de@@ st@@ ined to repe@@ at each other 's mista@@ kes ,
each other 's tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s .
for how do we see the world
if not through their l@@ en@@ s ?
the same f@@ ears , the same desi@@ res ?
do we see them as an ex@@ a@@ mp@@ le to follow ,
or as a warning of what to avoid ?
choo@@ sing to live as they have
simply because it 's what we know ,
or dri@@ ven to crea@@ te one 's own identi@@ ty ?
and what happens when we find them
to be a disappoin@@ tment ?
can we re@@ place them ?
our mo@@ thers , our fa@@ thers ?
or will de@@ stin@@ y find a way to drive us back ?
back to the familiar comfor@@ ts of home ?
to be continued …
from photo shoot to catwalk , join me as we push 1@@ 4 a@@ spir@@ ing supermodel drea@@ ms .
the winner will recei@@ ve $ 100 , 000 , a contr@@ act with top model agen@@ cy , new york model mana@@ ge@@ ment , and be f@@ ea@@ tur@@ ed in a fashion pic@@ tor@@ ial for " g@@ q .
s@@ ar@@ ah , we can 't make you a supermodel .
yeah .
this is a big part of your career .
i 'm not feeling as sex@@ y anymore .
today , you 're going to be han@@ ging from the ce@@ iling .
who do you find the most att@@ rac@@ tive in the house ?
he 's a beautiful guy .
he 's got a great heart .
you complain way too much .
i really see you as the weakest link .
let 's gan@@ g up on dom .
katy is not high fashion .
ben , he looks stiff .
dominic .
ben , dominic , katy , america will vote .
you better not be eating that before you go to sleep ?
why not ?
a couple hours after hearing he was in the bottom three , dom was still pi@@ ssed and was taking it out on everyone in the house .
i have been hearing my name ran@@ dom@@ ly .
a lot of models in the house don 't like me .
they don 't like dominic .
a lot of the girls in the house are back stab@@ b@@ ers .
some of you guys talk about each other .
i came out of the sho@@ wer and someone said there was a lot of trash talking down@@ stairs .
the whole house is open .
if someone is going to question my inte@@ g@@ rity
nobody - please con@@ front me .
wakey wakey .
jud@@ g@@ ment day .
you want me to come hold your hand ?
i don 't think it 's my time to go home yet .
just doing what we have done these two weeks has made me have such a passion for it .
i 'm not going to lose my roo@@ m@@ mate just yet .
i 'll be sitting by the door waiting for you to come through .
you better .
i want to hu@@ g you .
be strong .
honestly , i don 't know if i 'm going home today or not .
the american pu@@ b@@ lic voted me back on last week .
this week , it 's a whole new ba@@ ll@@ game .
everything happens for a reason .
you can 't lose two roo@@ mi@@ es .
the whole point of the competition is to make me a supermodel , not pick a supermodel off the street , ready to go .
after today , not going to be in a bo@@ dy@@ suit for a while , for sure .
i 'm sick of all these people .
we need to have two elimin@@ ations at a time .
scre@@ w this crap .
we 'll be sending one of you home today .
last week , we gave you a new look in ho@@ p@@ es of giving you a new look and attitude .
three of you disappointed us .
dominic , you 're back here at the bottom three again because of your walk .
we need a little bit of vari@@ e@@ ty from you .
ben , we really need to let down your guard .
katy , the other boys and the other girls are ev@@ ol@@ ving , and you 're not .
okay .
america voted on the all@@ tel wireless phone line .
here is their decision .
america has given you another chance at being a supermodel .
nice job .
dominic and katy , both of you have been here before .
and today , one of you will be going home .
you 're safe once again .
dominic , america has voted .
and i 'm sorry .
we can 't make you a supermodel .
thanks , guys .
i feel a bit cheated .
i got a little fa@@ ul@@ ty co@@ ach@@ ing and advice on how to walk .
that obviously didn 't go over well with the panel .
that would be the biggest bu@@ mm@@ er if i went home and people were like , you 're the guy who can 't walk .
you 're the guy who is stiff because i can walk .
it 's not a problem .
just give me sho@@ es that maybe f@@ it .
do you ...
i think ...
dom always tri@@ es to come off as saying " i 'm not going to complain , but here 's what i 'm going to complain about “ .
if katy and dom come back , i 'm going to walk out of the room .
the longer ben goes in this thing , the more he 'll learn .
we have the mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion of who we want to go home and who deserves to go home .
who deserves to be out of the house .
katy 's back .
watch out , guys .
i feel great that ben 's back .
the fact that ben is my biggest competition and the fact i want him to be in the house as long as possible , they don 't have to be mu@@ tually ex@@ clusi@@ ve .
i want to win for sure .
i would roll ben over in a second to win this competition in the end .
i feel good that katy 's back .
it 's got to be difficult .
the only two vo@@ tes , she 's been up for both of them .
that 's got to be a blow to her confi@@ dence , so i 'm proud of her for keeping her head high .
we went to a clo@@ thing company for a kind of a ca@@ sting call .
a lot of ad ca@@ mpa@@ ig@@ ns are about rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps and in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy .
they put us in tw@@ os and thre@@ es to see who had chemistry in front of the camera and who didn 't .
this is so fun .
who do you think you didn 't work the best with ?
i didn 't go up with all of the guys .
i didn 't go with frankie .
are you kidding me ?
i was like , e@@ w , no .
frea@@ k .
he has this f@@ ab@@ io thing .
yeah .
frankie 's name is f@@ ab@@ io because of his long hair , he does this thing with his hair and it 's all in his face and he thinks he 's god 's gift to women , and he 's not .
he was all
that 's what it looks like .
like he 's trying to think too hard and it hurts his face .
how hard do you want it ?
really hard .
can you give me 1@@ 10 ?
you 're cont@@ ro@@ lling .
there are some mi@@ xed sig@@ n@@ als with ben .
i know he 's married , but at the same time , he 's kind of all@@ u@@ ded to the fact that maybe if he , you know , had a couple co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils or whatever , he would be open to the idea of being intimate with a guy .
say hello to the camera .
i 'm right here .
it 's difficult , because i don 't think he reali@@ zes that i 'm not playing .
i actually do have some genuine feel@@ ings for him .
and he 's playing along , but i just don 't know to what ext@@ ent , you know , where that would lead , if anywhere .
there we go .
look at that hair .
that 's 100 ?
that 's 100 right there .
i think there 's certainly some chemistry between all three of us , actually .
i think aaryn , ben , and i have become very close friends .
shar@@ ing our man , right ?
you take ...
you 're taking what ?
who 's going to get his attention ?
i have to look at the camera .
ben and aaryn are very stea@@ my .
i feel like , you know , a lot is about to come out .
apparently , ben is not the genuine sou@@ ther@@ n boy i thought he was .
i 'd ...
what ?
if ...
what would make me so happy ? - if aaryn and ben ended up together .
they 're pretty convincing .
a little too convincing .
the wife find out .
today 's photo as@@ sig@@ nment is sexual chemistry .
we need to turn the he@@ at up , guys .
everyone knows sex se@@ lls .
think about all of the high @-@ fashion a@@ ds we have seen .
if you 're not rela@@ xed in front of the camera , it 's definitely going to show .
you won 't get the job and you won 't be hired .
okay .
she shoo@@ ts a lot of intimate stuff for like ger@@ man " vo@@ gue , " " g@@ q , " " e@@ ll@@ e " .
we 're going to do an intimate shoot with lots of sexual chemistry .
it 's acting , forget about your girl@@ friends , your boy@@ friends .
if some of you get exc@@ ited , that 's okay .
so you have to connect with your eyes .
i want fire in your eyes .
not just good @-@ looking and bor@@ ed .
don 't be sh@@ y , all right ?
listen to her , because some of you haven 't been listening and your photos haven 't been coming out good .
i want you to listen and learn .
i made up pa@@ irs .
these two .
ronnie and shannon .
aaryn and jay .
holly and frankie .
then we have ben and katy .
all right .
then we have stephanie and jacki .
it 's going to get a little fun .
then we have perry and casey .
st@@ y@@ ling , go .
i was a little nervous , but we talked about it , and i 'm not nervous .
yeah , okay .
i think we need to get perry to do the shot .
just got to ro@@ ck it out .
you know , the job .
yeah , i 'm kind of nervous .
wondering if i 'll still have a boyfriend after this one .
we 're up for anything , i guess .
cool , yeah. great .
everybody at hope probably thinks , oh , they 're so into it .
it 's so weird because you have camera guy and lights and ma@@ ke@@ up arti@@ sts .
he 's doing a great job , i hope .
this is kind of part of the job .
you know , my wife knows that going into it .
she 's going to be frea@@ ked out watching it , still .
me and katy , we made the chemistry , and we rocked it out today .
ben and katy did work very hard .
thank you very much .
brilliant .
jacki , are you really going to let me li@@ ck you from your head to your toe ?
i ordered the champagne for you .
i 'm not kidding .
she 's going to dou@@ se you with champagne and then li@@ ck it off .
how are you ?
good .
what are you wearing ?
my partner is jay , and he was one of the guys .
i probably have the least amount of , like , chemistry with .
very na@@ ugh@@ ty look .
nic@@ e. great .
jay , close your eyes and look at her .
sex@@ y is going to get real mist@@ y in here in a minute .
i might go at you with b@@ ite marks .
i think aaryn stru@@ gg@@ led with po@@ ses .
if you don 't smile , you 're not the girl next door .
you 're falling into too much po@@ sing , which was tri@@ cky to get her out of that and make it natural .
jay was very pa@@ ssive , like he would be the one la@@ ying down .
i wanted him to take control and swing me around a little bit and come up with some ideas .
instead , it was mostly me s@@ w@@ inging jay around .
i think jay and aaryn didn 't have sexual chemistry between them at all .
really try to get the chemistry on between you two .
in the back of my head , i 'm like , baby ,
i know you 're at home watching , but please don 't get mad at me .
ti@@ lt it back , like that .
i was having fun and i felt like i wasn 't
i haven 't had a girlfriend , but it was in a profession@@ al way .
it wasn 't no hu@@ mp@@ ing and all that stuff .
it was real nice , ta@@ ste@@ ful .
i told aaryn , once you go black , you never go back , baby .
that 's real .
this looks very tri@@ cky in the beginning .
let 's make it look like friends .
more like sexual chemistry .
the last 10 , 20 pictures were really good .
okay , let 's move on the bed .
this is great .
you can take the bra off .
you can do it .
no , i have not been in an intimate position with a woman , but it 's comfortable , and i want to get a good picture out of it .
great , great .
hold your le@@ gs up .
more faces .
do something .
great .
i have never been in a hotel room with a girl before .
i can 't say i wouldn 't have gone there if someone ha@@ dn 't inter@@ ven@@ ed at one point or another .
that 's really hot .
nic@@ e. cool .
thank you very much .
you guys make out ?
maybe .
all i can say is i 'm proud of jacki , that she surprised me with her ton@@ gue .
this is what it really comes down to working on tea@@ m@@ work , especially with people who don 't like each other .
with holly , there 's no chemistry at all .
frankie and holly , i want to see if he would be your boyfriend , what he would make you feel like .
it 's really , really hard because you had to be , like , into them .
try to totally connect .
it 's , like , really -- first of all for me , my fi@@ anc@@ é and i , we 're waiting until we get married .
so it 's like really weird i have to sh@@ are that with someone else .
of all people , frankie .
i don 't think she has what it takes to be in the competition .
she 's got what it takes , but she 's bor@@ ing at hell .
how are you supposed to bu@@ i@@ ld chemistry when you feel like they 're dis@@ gu@@ sted by you ?
it su@@ cked , you know .
it was like i was trying to a blow @-@ up do@@ ll , man .
holly and frankie were very , very hard .
she didn 't feel comfortable , and i felt it in the picture .
see this right here ?
this dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c du@@ o of sex@@ in@@ ess ?
that 's what rocked the sheets .
we 're going to shoot on the bed .
it will be quite sexual .
you can do whatever you want .
you can strang@@ le each other if that turns you on .
you can do whatever you want .
in the beginning , i was a bit sh@@ y , obviously .
did ... ?
try not to lau@@ gh .
great .
then , within like five minutes ,
i started to engage with each other and had lots of fun .
- can i ?
yeah .
i 'm like so into this right now .
enough about the lo@@ lli@@ pop , because that could look a little gay .
really ?
don 't want to come across as that .
oh , go closer and then his hair , yeah .
a lot of li@@ cking going on , and b@@ iting .
and ni@@ pp@@ le pin@@ ching .
great , doing it again , nice .
i 'm kind of glad i did it with a guy because now i don 't have that whole ,
i have to explain this to my girlfriend .
now it 's like , wow , my boyfriend 's gay .
it 's on the pictures you see the chemistry , and you do , definitely .
i was actually surprised how willing they were to actually do something .
one , two , three , go .
great , nice .
brilli@@ ant. thank you very much .
did you see the girls in there ?
so hot .
i know , i loved it .
i love girls .
what 's up , lo@@ vers ? how 'd it go .
you guys are all done .
nice .
ronnie has never been with a woman .
i 'm going to take his virgin@@ ity .
great .
today was gro@@ ping and kissing and feeling each other .
it was certainly a challenge for me .
straight yet , ronnie ?
almost , right on the ver@@ ge .
maybe if you give me some kissing action .
great , nice .
yeah , that 's perfect .
great .
i was definitely turned on with shannon .
it caught me by surprise because i wasn 't expecting to enjoy it .
great .
ronnie and shannon left their personal lives out of this room , so it was absolutely perfect .
the last one .
nice .
thank you very much .
we 're getting married .
right now .
aaryn and jay , and holly and frankie are my bottom pa@@ ir because aaryn was very po@@ sing in the beginning .
and jay just kind of happened to be there .
frankie and holly were really difficult , especially holly was difficult because she looked really scared .
top two pa@@ irs were casey and perry and ronnie and shannon .
perry and casey , they ac@@ ted so well that it actually looks as if they would totally have sex .
ronnie was fun , and shannon as well .
they were great .
it was an absolu@@ te pleasure to meet you all .
see you later .
not everybody gets drunk after a photo shoot , okay ?
look , i wasn 't so bad .
some people here want to be an ac@@ tor or like , they don 't understand how bad i want this .
i know i had a bad picture , but i don 't want it to end for just one little photo shoot , especially with frankie of all things .
the situation of being thrown in bed with someone and , like , i didn 't want to do it .
me and holly have already had a di@@ sp@@ ute .
i wasn 't upset with working at holly because i know she 's good at taking pictures , but she d@@ rank so much .
she d@@ rank a good two red cu@@ ps , man , and i know right before she went in there , dude , her eyes were bloo@@ d@@ shot .
and just the whole
i expected so much more from her .
when i found out frankie was telling america basically that i was drunk at our photo shoot ,
i was so sho@@ cked .
he 's just a trash tal@@ ker that tra@@ shes everyone .
i can 't believe he said i got drunk on my photo shoot .
is this a tac@@ tic to get america to think i was drunk on a photo shoot ?
what the he@@ ck ?
it 's ...
frankie , this is not true at all .
there 's three bott@@ les of champagne .
i could have seen it that way .
if ...
i ...
i felt it. i felt the vi@@ be .
did ...
i 'm not going to sit here and take it .
not everybody gets drunk before a photo shoot .
you 're right ...
yes , you were , dude .
so that 's it .
end of story , okay ?
drop it .
okay .
you 're an ass .
thank you. sorry .
hello , models , welcome to stu@@ di@@ o x .
nice to meet you all .
i will be your personal train@@ er .
as super@@ models , you need to stay in perfect shape , every day , every minute , is that clear ?
yes .
let 's start with the guys first .
la@@ dies against the wall .
ready to do it ?
cli@@ mb the hands , touch the floor .
watching the boys do their first workout , he 's su@@ per intense .
con@@ stantly going , going , going , and i 'm nervous about ours .
three , two , one .
are you ready ?
yeah .
are you ready ?
yeah .
let 's do it .
this hurts .
getting kicked off the show hurts a lot worse .
i can 't catch my breath .
come on , gir@@ l. you got it .
tou@@ gh@@ en up , all right .
aaryn was definitely the weakest person out there today .
i 'm learning a lot about your guys .
a whole lot .
some people are really pushing it .
and some are not .
all right , girls , you 're done .
today 's workout was really tough .
it was especially tough for me personally , but i 'm here to be a supermodel , and i 'm going to do whatever it takes .
models , phone ca@@ lls tonight .
what do you guys think ?
i mean , ben , after the photo shoot and everything , are you a little app@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sive about talking to your wife ?
it was innocent .
i didn 't catch wood .
you know , i didn 't really like get into it in the sexual sense as much as the acting sense of being sexual .
hey , ben .
phone call .
what ?
hello .
what 's going on , baby ?
nothing .
what you doing ?
just waiting for you to call me .
oh , how are things ?
good .
they 're good .
i miss you a lo@@ t. i miss you .
20 days .
hearing her voice , it was kind of sa@@ d that she was upset and that changes the whole per@@ spe@@ c@@ tive .
it kind of brings you back down .
is everything there really nice ?
yeah , it 's really cool in the house .
me and aaryn are good friends .
oh , no .
yeah i know .
not gay friends , good friends .
it makes me realize , wow , i 'm here having this ama@@ zing time , and back home , you know , my wife is missing me like crazy .
aaryn was nervous going into her phone call because she was definitely having some doubt about , you know , where her life is going right now .
i mean , her life is really up in the a@@ ir .
hey , baby .
how are you .
i miss you so much , aaryn .
there 's no end to how much i have missed you .
i miss you .
hey , i 'm here .
you okay , baby ?
no .
nobody can predi@@ ct the future .
that 's half the fun of it .
so right now , i have to take a dee@@ p breath and put our future on hold so that i can fo@@ c@@ us on my future right now .
it just has opened my eyes so much to the fact that my life is never going to be the same after this .
nothing is ever going to be the same .
you 're saying you don 't
not in the re@@ gar@@ ds of us lo@@ ving each other and being together .
i 'm just saying it 's hard in this alter@@ n@@ ate rea@@ lity .
you don 't understand how difficult it is being here ?
where is this spee@@ ch going ?
i 'm telling you i love you , baby , and i 'm saying this is going to be so hard after this .
i understand , but you 're still going to want to be with me ?
still ... ?
you 're the only person i have to come home to .
what do you think ?
i want to mar@@ ry you so bad , i can 't see straight .
oh , honey .
she came in and was definitely inside herself .
you can tell there were a lot of things going through her mind .
he said ...
what did you say ?
i can 't see myself going home and doing that after all this .
it 's going to be like a whole new bag of problems on top of that .
use some inspiration .
this week has been all about chemistry .
you 're asked to smo@@ l@@ der with your partner at a photo shoot .
now we 're going to ask you to keep the he@@ at going for the catwalk .
this week 's catwalk as@@ sig@@ nment is e@@ que@@ stri@@ an with a fe@@ ti@@ sh twist .
you need to think ga@@ uti@@ er dressing ma@@ d@@ onna for her last t@@ our .
you guys will be working with your photo shoot partner .
so to give you some inspiration
here are some too@@ ls of the trade .
there 's a ton of whi@@ ps and crazy looking appar@@ at@@ us de@@ vic@@ es .
i don 't know .
remember , at the end of the show , three of you will be up for the vote .
so if we 're going to make you a supermodel , remember to think big , take ch@@ ances , and out@@ sh@@ ine the other cou@@ pl@@ es .
all right , off to your st@@ y@@ list@@ s , and get ready .
some people , i just don 't think they like it .
i think we 're going to use it .
it 's a lot of weight to have on your shoulders that you 're af@@ fe@@ cting your partner .
we 're just not going to let it happen where we think about are we in the bottom three .
we were both in it last week .
this week was all about chemistry .
and ronnie and i had chemistry .
we went out there .
he and i had a blast .
oh , how i love my job .
i think our chemistry , we have really been working on it .
i feel really comfortable .
i felt frankie and i were a lot better than yesterday .
there 's no feeling like being on the runway .
that 's what i want to experi@@ ence every single day .
we had great chemistry on the catwalk and showed the jud@@ ges we really want this .
the catwalk was crazy .
we had an idea of what we were going to do .
at this point , i was like , you know what ?
i went here , did my job .
let 's see what the panel had to say .
three weeks , you 're learning so much .
i 'm not ready to go home .
we absolutely killed it .
we had so much freaking energy , and they were so exc@@ ited to see us .
there was so much en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
okay , models .
before we evalu@@ ate your work , we want to ask you a few questions .
ronnie and shannon , the catwalk , i loved how you came out , you mar@@ ched like a hor@@ se .
who came up with the ch@@ or@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ rap@@ h@@ y , you guys ?
we bl@@ ended it together .
we took our inspiration from the e@@ que@@ stri@@ an , thinking like a hor@@ se , and trying to throw in the twist of fe@@ ti@@ shes in there .
it was really fun .
you brought your photos to the catwalk today .
very good job .
aaryn and jay .
there 's no natural chemistry between us .
the fact that we came up with any chemistry i thought was profession@@ ally a victory .
jay , if you could pick any other girl to pose with , who would it be ?
aaryn ?
i think the way i looked at it ,
i should have been able to have chemistry with anybody .
casey and perry , how did you guys come up with these po@@ ses ?
how did you feel in this photo shoot ?
you look very comfortable .
when i first met casey , the first time in new york , in@@ stantly , we had this comm@@ uni@@ cation , like this sense of humor .
we get each other .
we finish each other 's
senten@@ ces .
you know .
it 's something that we 're really
into .
casey , no thought went through your head when perry li@@ cked your head ?
well , the only thought was there was a camera right there .
i 'm really sorry , dad .
very sal@@ ty , i would say .
very sal@@ ty .
that 's very confi@@ dent in their sex@@ u@@ ality to be like
it takes a real man to put his ton@@ gue on another man like that .
frankie and holly , the chemistry wasn 't all there , huh ?
not really .
not really ?
what is it , you guys don 't like each other ?
we have had differ@@ en@@ ces in the house .
we tried to put that aside .
i think that whatever is going on between you obviously trans@@ lated into the photo .
because the both of you didn 't look comfortable .
it was not one of the best .
frankie , did you even try ?
i did .
definit@@ el@@ y. i 'm a real sexual person , and like , she was looking at me like dis@@ gu@@ sting , you know .
i know you 're a re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous person so it was going to be hard for you .
my fi@@ anc@@ é and i , we don 't have sex .
we wanted to wait until we get married .
you forget that your signific@@ ant other is at home and just forget it .
this is bad for you guys , you know .
on to jacki and stephanie .
wow , your photo shoot .
stephanie , it looks like you were taking control ?
is that true ?
i think maybe i was more comfortable with it ini@@ tially .
no att@@ rac@@ tion here ?
i 'm not , like , sex@@ ually att@@ racted to jacki , but to me , i think women are really beautiful , and it 's not hard for me to picture that at all .
let me ask you a question .
you 're not told what to do in the photo shoot or the catwalk .
you guys decided to kiss at the end of the runway .
whose decision was that ?
i had to convince her .
we went for it .
i wanted ours to stand out from everyone else 's .
you may head back to the dressing room as we evalu@@ ate you work and three of you will be up for the vote .
let 's start with perry and casey .
i wouldn 't expect this from perry .
it came p@@ ou@@ ring out .
perry and casey came out .
perry just , you know , turned it .
they laugh@@ ed .
they had fun .
i think a job well done on both their par@@ ts .
ben and katy , i 'm so proud of them .
i thought she looked great , and i thought she 's trying so hard .
the walk is his weakne@@ ss .
he 's got a great look , but his walk is killing the dude .
let 's talk about jay .
there 's just no chemistry , no connection between the two of them .
i didn 't believe it .
it didn 't look like they were comfortable .
it was very stiff .
when all three pho@@ to@@ g@@ rap@@ h@@ ers who worked with jay , they said no ex@@ pression .
it 's work .
it 's a lot of work .
i love ronnie and shannon .
they just brought it today .
ronnie and shannon really want this .
i love this girl .
they 're both willing to give 100 % .
yeah .
that 's what i like about the two of them .
yeah .
frankie and holly .
for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
them not getting along with each other shot both of them in the foot .
i felt the same way about their catwalk today .
there weren 't smi@@ les .
no fun involved at all .
stephanie , in these pictures , you can see she took command .
again , i think jacki 's playing it safe .
she was so into stephanie about doing this photo that she brought jacki right into it with her .
they ste@@ pped it up tonight .
the runway was great .
holding and kiss .
we know who did the best and the worst this week .
let 's bring them out .
there are eight models standing before us .
four of you gave us supermodel @-@ style chemistry .
three of you did not .
and will be put up for the vote .
shannon and ronnie , perry an casey , this week was all about chemistry .
you guys definitely had it .
your photos were stea@@ my and very believ@@ able .
and your catwalk was elec@@ tri@@ c .
shannon , once again , you 're a top perform@@ er .
you 're safe this week .
you may leave the catwalk .
casey , we had almost given up on you , but this week , you surprised us .
you 're safe .
you may leave the catwalk .
ronnie , you are a gay man , and we asked you to play it straight .
you were hot .
perry , you are a straight man , and you were asked to play gay .
you rocked it .
perry , you are this week 's winner .
you may leave the catwalk .
well done .
ronnie , great job again .
you may leave the catwalk .
there are four of you standing before us .
three of you will be put up for the vote .
this week was about making a connection .
and you went in alone .
there was no chemistry between you and jay .
once again , your photo disappointed us .
we 're looking for a sp@@ ark , and you just didn 't have any .
you let your personal circumstances get in the way of doing your job , and you brought frankie down with you .
you couldn 't bri@@ dge the ga@@ p with holly .
a supermodel always finds a way .
you 're up for the vote .
you , too , are up for the vote .
frankie and holly
it 's down to you two .
you are also up for the vote .
that means frankie , you are safe .
please leave the catwalk .
whether you stay or you go is now out of our hands .
it 's up to america to decide who we can make a supermodel .
good luck .
you may leave the catwalk .
the all@@ tel wireless phone lines are now open and will remain open until 4 : 00 am ea@@ st@@ ern time .
and you can vote on@@ line at bra@@ vo@@ t@@ v@@ . co@@ m .
i 'm cr@@ ying on the inside and the outside .
this is what i wan@@ ted. this is my drea@@ m , and i 'm not going to let nothing get in my way .
this is what i have been working towards since i was like 12 .
i have been through a lot of circumstances with mode@@ ling .
and everyone has that .
i didn 't think i deser@@ ved to be in the bottom three .
i did the best shot i could .
i have been here to really be competi@@ tive .
you know , do my best the whole way and do it with some inte@@ g@@ rity .
gary doesn 't lie .
intimate but not small -- check .
charac@@ ter -- double check .
see ? gary doesn 't lie .
and the best part@@ -- i 've been working the owner for months ,
convincing her to sell .
you 're getting in first .
it " s not even on the market yet .
so , you like ?
the house ? yes .
gary ? maybe not .
doris : good morning , everyone .
hey. hello , doris .
i want you to meet your first potential bu@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ --@@ fri@@ tz and brenda .
thank you for coming .
would anyone like a fre@@ sh@@ ly ba@@ ked coo@@ kie ?
thank you .
you 're welcome it 's ... ?
i 'm surprised you want to leave .
oh , i don 't , really .
no , i put it on the market last summer ,
and then i changed my mind .
but the house has gone up in value so much that everybody thinks i should take the money and run .
more coffee ?
no , i think that -- yes , please. okay .
you know , we ra@@ i@@ sed three children in this house .
my husband , to@@ m -- he put those ca@@ bin@@ ets in himself .
oh .
more coffee ?
yes , thank you .
hey .
we can ri@@ p those out -- no problem .
more company !
deputy chief johnson .
i thought you said this place wasn 't listed yet .
it 's not supposed to be .
yes , lieutenant , what is it ?
someone at my office must have noticed it was back on the market .
why ? what happened ?
he 's how old ?
oh , for heaven 's sake .
no , no. i 'll be right there .
thank you .
what if we wanted to make an offer ?
what ?
hey , chief. fax for you .
" rules of escrow " ?
thank you !
so , this guy was pushing around some sick old man in a wheelchair near ho@@ lly@@ wood b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard .
tao : a tou@@ rist finally gave him a ce@@ ll@@ phone to call 911 ,
but by the time the para@@ medi@@ cs got there ,
the guy in the wheelchair was dead ,
which might have been the end of it , but
except our el@@ der@@ ly gentle@@ man here clai@@ med he murdered the victim .
10 to 1 , here 's what happened .
my heart !
help !
help !
and then ho@@ lly@@ wood divi@@ sion pushed him our way [ ban@@ g ] so that they could enjoy their sunday .
tao : they 're just following the rules , chief .
thing is , our old guy claims to have killed six other people the same way .
and how did he do that ?
he won 't say. he won 't tell us his name , either .
he didn 't have any i. d. on him ,
and neither did the dead guy .
all right .
okay .
if i can de@@ ter@@ mine that this man 's delusional ,
that he belongs to the men@@ tal evalu@@ ation un@@ it ,
then we can all go home and save on overtime .
in the meantime ...
detec@@ tives daniels and san@@ che@@ z ,
please take a pe@@ e@@ k at missing persons .
see if anyone 's looking for two na@@ me@@ less old men .
lieutenant provenza , please make sure that our victim is on a gu@@ r@@ ney at the morgue .
and , lieutenant tao ,
if you wouldn 't mind sending this fax to the number on the cover sh@@ e@@ et
it 's some , um , thin@@ gy for my real @-@ estate agent .
thank you. thank you so much .
good morning , sir .
i 'm deputy chief brenda le@@ i@@ gh johnson .
could you please tell me your name ?
how about the name of the man who died ?
i murdered him ...
and the others -- i killed them all .
and how did you do that ?
poison .
you know that you poisoned a total of seven people ,
but you don 't know your name ?
who says i don 't know my name ?
a deputy chief , huh ? that 's pretty im@@ pre@@ ssive .
there 's -- what ? -- 12 of you in the whole department ?
sir , there are several in@@ consi@@ st@@ en@@ ci@@ es to your story .
i actually remember that detective provenza guy who put me in here .
he was a high@@ ly mo@@ tiv@@ ated young man .
bet your s@@ weet ass i was .
have you been arrested before ?
i spent some time here when i was youn@@ ger .
what is it about my story that 's in@@ consistent ?
well , you claim you tried to poison someone ,
and yet , you called 911 .
if you were really trying to murder someone ,
why call for help ?
well , uh , i wanted to see what it was like dying , you know ?
i didn 't watch the others , but it went on too long ,
and i chi@@ ck@@ en@@ ed out .
all right , uh , sir ,
i @-@ i 'm afraid that you might not be com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent to speak on your own be@@ half 。
you 're worried about my san@@ ity , huh ?
i have a right to remain silent .
anything i say can and will be used against me in a court of la@@ w. sir .
i have a right to an attorney .
if i cannot af@@ ford one , et ce@@ ter@@ a , et ce@@ ter@@ a. sir .
blah , blah , blah .
look , let me make something completely clear
i do not want a lawy@@ er. under@@ st@@ ood ?
and if you don 't know how to as@@ semb@@ le your case ,
let me give you a little hint -- bernard kaplan .
is that your name ?
no , it 's the name of your dead joh@@ n doe .
and i 'll trade you the na@@ mes of the other six people i killed if you 'll give me something to eat .
all right .
na@@ mes , please .
lieutenant provenza , i 'm almost afraid to ask you this .
do you remember anything about this old man ?
well , if you twisted my arm , i 'd say he looks familiar .
that 's about it .
chief , i ran , uh , " rump@@ le 's " prints through afis along with bernard kaplan
no hits on either man .
tao , what 's a rumple@@ stiltskin ?
[ ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling ] it 's a fairy ta@@ le .
there 's this old d@@ war@@ f who won 't tell the que@@ en his name ,
and she has to guess it in order to -- uh @-@ huh .
well , if rumple@@ stiltskin has wan@@ dered away from home ,
it 's been less than 24 hours .
missing persons hasn 't gener@@ ated a report yet .
all right. sergeant gabriel ,
let 's head over to the cor@@ on@@ er 's office ,
see if we can get some death certificates ...
chief. i can go to the morgue with you .
we 'll sort this out .
oh , chief , um , this , uh , fax ...
didn 't quite make it through .
um , i called the service guy .
he 's supposed to be here tomorrow morning , 11 : 00 a. m ..
lieutenant tao , thank you .
i 'll find another fax machine along the way .
gabriel came off suspension friday night .
why don 't you give him a call to come in ?
but we 'll be done with this before he even gets here .
would you just do it , flynn ?
god , you 're a pain in the ass .
let me guess -- natural causes ?
if we were guessing ,
i wouldn 't be cu@@ tting the old guy open .
and pulling out his inte@@ stin@@ es .
i 'd still be at br@@ unch with my friends , having a mi@@ mo@@ s@@ a .
well , dr. mor@@ al@@ es , i 'm so sorry to interrupt your sunday ,
but it 's important to estab@@ lish that mr. kaplan here is not a ho@@ m@@ icide victim .
well , you better wipe off your cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball , honey ,
because this guessing thing isn 't working for you .
mr. kaplan was murdered ?
you see this na@@ st@@ y ir@@ ri@@ tation along the e@@ so@@ p@@ ha@@ gu@@ s ?
some he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ging , too -- there and there ,
and the sto@@ ma@@ ch was pretty tor@@ n up .
which means violent vom@@ iting before death .
even in adv@@ ance of a tox screen , i 'd say poison .
all the offic@@ es with fax machines were closed , chief ,
so no luck sending this .
oh , shoot .
but i did dig up six death certificates ,
one for each name that the old man gave us .
now , they all died within the last year .
and get this -- they all lived at a place called the summer view senior living center .
now , while the certificates indi@@ cate that they died of natural causes ,
they 're all signed by the same physi@@ ci@@ an .
all right , mr. stiltskin , i 'm not igno@@ ring you anymore .
thank you so much !
just work .
what are you doing here ? you mean , in my office ?
oh , sorry. um ...
you 're holding a delusional old man in an interview room on a sunday af@@ ter@@ no@@ on . -- yeah , i know that .
you 're wra@@ pping that up , right ,
sending everybody home until tomorrow ?
uh , not exactly .
look , it 's ir@@ ri@@ ta@@ ting , i know .
but as it turns out ,
the dead guy actually was poisoned ,
which means that we have six more potential victims .
so , get the death certificates .
that 'll have a cause of dea@@ th@@ . we did that .
they all suppo@@ se@@ dly died of natural causes .
but each death certifi@@ cate was signed by the same doctor .
and when a doctor signs off on a death certifi@@ cate ... [ fax machine be@@ e@@ ps ]
there 's no au@@ to@@ p@@ sy .
oh , my god , brenda , tell me you didn 't just fax orders for the ex@@ hu@@ mation of six bodies .
okay , i didn 't .
i just faxed the offer .
i have the confir@@ mation in my hand .
well , nothing has come th@@ rough@@ . can you just do it again ?
gary says doris could get another offer any minute .
and gary doesn 't lie .
it 's there ... in the machine .
it 's not .
all right. i 'll try and send it again later .
for heaven 's sake !
oh , chief , if you can believe it ,
six of the dead bodies were cremated .
track down the ashes .
any family me@@ mbers give you a problem , get a warrant .
uh , lieutenant tao ,
are we signed to search the nursing home ?
uh , not quite .
the judge wants us to speci@@ fy the room numbers we want to look at .
[ si@@ gh@@ ing ] oh .
oh@@ h !
we have de@@ termin@@ ed that the six people you named ...
are , in fact , de@@ c@@ ea@@ sed .
and they all lived at the same nursing home pri@@ or to their deaths .
congratula@@ tions , young lady .
you 're that much closer to finding out who i am .
and that much closer to treating you like a murder@@ er ,
which seems to be what you want !
now , i have a warrant to search mr. kaplan 's room ,
but i need a room number .
might you have a room at this facility , as well ?
find out for yourself .
say " ch@@ ee@@ se . "
thank you .
oh ! oh ! hi .
sergeant gabriel !
what are you doing here ?
i thought you weren 't coming back until tomorrow .
i @-@ i spoke to daniels ,
and she said the squad was on call ,
and my , uh , suspension was up friday .
uh , i think this fax came for you .
oh , shoot !
i faxed myself .
chief , nursing home a@@ wa@@ its !
oh , yes , thank you .
um , i just need to ... send a fax .
oh , sergeant gabriel ...
uh , if you could , please bab@@ y@@ sit the suspect while i 'm gone .
thank you .
and there 's no need to beat information out of this old man .
he 's been confe@@ ssing all morning .
can you sign these , please ?
what ? i did sign them .
i faxed them to you before i left .
you faxed me your warrant ,
which is how i knew where to find you .
oh , fri@@ tz .
oh , i 'm sorry .
look , i 'm dealing with a potential seri@@ al killer here .
okay ? a vic@@ ious murder@@ er .
named rumple@@ stilt@@ sk@@ in. yes , i know .
here. just sign , please .
oh , hi , there .
i 'm nurse sti@@ le@@ s. you must be here for a t@@ our .
oh , par@@ don me .
hi , i 'm nurse town@@ sen@@ d. how can i help ?
is bernard kaplan a re@@ sident here ?
oh , my. i reported him missing today .
is he okay ?
when did you notice he was gone ?
early morning .
i was just finishing my r@@ ounds ,
and i noticed mr. kaplan and mr. baxter 's rooms were empty .
is this mr. baxter ?
yes , it is -- donald baxter !
are he and mr. kaplan okay ?
mr. baxter 's room number , please ?
um , 3@@ 09 .
should i call the manager ?
you can if you like .
wait ! wait , wait , wait .
you 've got to sign the visitors ' book !
there 's nothing in kaplan 's room , chief .
[ si@@ gh@@ ing ] oh. thank you .
it kills me -- white people pay all this money to store their families in plac@@ es like this .
we throw some carpet in the gar@@ age , everyone 's welcome .
looking at these pictures ,
doesn 't look like mr. baxter has any family at all .
there 's all kin@@ ds of research on pois@@ ons here , chief .
provenza : wait a minute .
[ ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling ] wait a minute. i do recognize him .
yeah , baxter -- donald baxter .
he had the police beat on the ne@@ wspaper when i was first starting out , chief .
how did he end up here ?
don 't worry , lieuten@@ ant. i 'll come visit you .
excuse me. who 's in charge here ?
deputy chief brenda le@@ i@@ gh johnson .
and you are ...
jud@@ d wha@@ le@@ y. i 'm the manager .
i really would have pre@@ ferred fore@@ warning about your visit .
well , i 'm sorry about that ,
but when we call ahead to ex@@ e@@ cute a search warrant ,
we often find no one 's home .
excuse me. step back , please , sir .
are mr. kaplan and mr. baxter okay ?
mr. kaplan is dead , and mr. baxter is in custody .
why is mr. baxter in custody ?
he claims to have poisoned mr. kaplan .
oh , my god .
but ...
look , mr. baxter can be trou@@ ble@@ some ,
a little paranoid at times ,
but he and mr. kaplan were friends .
paranoid -- in what way ?
another one of his friends passed away several months ago ,
and mr. baxter took it very hard .
he suff@@ ered what our doctor diagno@@ sed as a psychotic break ,
and so , occasionally , mr. baxter makes crazy acc@@ us@@ ations .
like what ?
si@@ lly things , like cla@@ im@@ ing that the staff is sp@@ ying on him .
dr. reisen put him on hal@@ do@@ l , an anti@@ psychotic ,
and all indi@@ cations -- are these dr. reisen 's signatu@@ res on all these death certificates ?
yes , they are .
because if these six people were poisoned ,
as mr. baxter claims ,
and dr. reisen mis@@ diagno@@ sed them ...
nobody is poisoning people here .
not mr. baxter and certainly no one on summer view 's staff .
well , as it so happens , mr. kaplan 's body does show signs of poisoning .
what ? oh@@ h .
my god .
do you think mr. baxter would poison someone to prove a point ?
as crazy as that may sound , we can 't take the chance .
i 'm afraid we can 't allow mr. baxter to return to summer view .
it 's simply not safe for the rest of our senior family .
also , as a matter of proce@@ du@@ re ,
i 'm gonna have to treat these six other deaths as murders ...
until i can de@@ ter@@ mine otherwise .
now , hold on .
we run one of the fin@@ est fac@@ ilities in the country .
check our records , our reputation .
whatever it takes , i 'll -- chief ...
you need to see something .
mr. whaley , we will certainly take you up on your offer .
that 's my hal@@ do@@ l .
aren 't you supposed to be taking this medication on a da@@ i@@ ly ba@@ sis , mr. baxter ?
yes .
it 's supposed to treat my so @-@ called " paranoid delusi@@ ons . "
unfortunately , it doesn 't work so well ,
since i never took it .
so now you 're ready to believe maybe i really did murder those seven people ?
i 'm starting to , yes .
then i ? ? ?
brenda : mr. baxter , you understand ...
it 's a little hard to take you seriously ,
especially since you ' ve quit your meds and are most likely suff@@ ering from psychotic delusi@@ ons .
the nursing home was using those pills to shut me up .
because i know what 's going on .
i know they 're killing people .
well , you do sound a little paranoid .
yeah , you see how that works ?
i know something bad is going on ,
so they say i 'm delusional and give me pills , drugs ,
to try and keep me quiet ,
knowing that , if i stop taking the drugs and speak up ,
i 'm gonna sound crazy .
why did you first tell us ...
that it was you who killed those people ?
it was the only way i could get you to listen to me .
and if it comes down to it ,
i 'd rather go to prison than back to that home .
well , you could have just filed a complaint .
i did file a complaint , with the police ,
but no one took me seriously ...
until now .
i 'm sorry i wasn 't more help@@ ful before ,
but i needed to know i could trust you ...
and i needed you to believe that murders had been comm@@ it@@ ted .
murders for which you are still the most likely suspect .
bernie was my last best friend. why would i kill him ?
well , if i 'm to believe the medical profession@@ als ,
it 's because you 're out of your mind !
and when i asked you why you poisoned mr. kaplan ,
you said it was to watch him die .
now , that 's just crazy .
exactly !
all right , for the sake of argument ,
what motive dro@@ ve summer view to murder seven of its paying customers ?
the customers weren 't paying enough .
look into it .
you 'll find that each of the victims had recently run out of money and had to go on medicaid .
that 's a ma@@ ssive lo@@ ss of in@@ come for summer view .
doesn 't sound insane to me .
in your room , we found research ma@@ ter@@ i@@ als on var@@ ious pois@@ ons .
i was trying to find out how they were killing us off .
i knew it was poison because so many of my friends got sick so su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
[ cr@@ ying ] but when poor bernie came down with the same sy@@ mp ,
i just wanted to try to get him some help .
why didn 't you call family ,
someone to take you to a hospital ?
i don 't have any family left ,
and you can forget going to dr. reisen or nurse townsend for help .
for all i know , one of them was responsible .
got the tox screen back for bernie kaplan positive for arsenic .
arsenic .
chief , we picked up nurse townsend .
she 's on her way .
we 're still looking into this dr. reisen .
and , uh , com@@ man@@ der ta@@ y@@ l@@ or says he 's checking into baxter 's claim that he filed a complaint .
thank you , sergeant .
uh , these files the manager gave us ,
i looked into summer view 's financi@@ al records
for all seven victims , and baxter was right ,
they were all on medicaid .
only problem ...
there are cur@@ ren@@ tly 11 other residents at summer view ,
who are also on medicaid , several of them for years .
so much for mr. baxter 's theory .
anything else ?
summer view seems like a really e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent place winner of several a@@ wards , com@@ men@@ da@@ tions ,
and mon@@ th@@ ly bonuses -- all based on occupancy .
so it 's hard to see why they 'd be killing off their customers .
okay , cremated remains for five of the vic@@ s .
what happened to number six ?
uh , family lost him in a move .
uh , this is , uh , jo@@ yce rob@@ in@@ son .
her daughter said she never got around to getting a pro@@ per ur@@ n .
mar@@ il@@ yn rob@@ er@@ ts -- her ni@@ e@@ ce says ...
yeah , i get the pic@@ tu@@ re. yeah .
someone 's family cared .
um , want to look a little more close@@ ly at the name , chief ?
they put mom 's ashes in the dog 's ur@@ n .
it 's not funny , flynn .
po@@ pe : how nice to see everybody spending time together off the clock .
this is some kind of team mor@@ a@@ le @-@ building ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , right ?
actually , chief po@@ pe , we may be looking at some overtime here ,
and i 'm sorry about that .
no. no overtime -- period .
and as for your suspect ,
either charge him or send him home .
i 'm not paying for him to spend the night here .
i 'm also not sh@@ e@@ lling out thous@@ an@@ ds of do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s for you to ex@@ hu@@ me six dead bodies based on the word of a seni@@ le old man .
okay ? so forget about that .
good night. b@@ y@@ e. let 's go .
uh , wait .
just -- just a second. um , just one second .
how about this ?
um , sign off on our overtime today ,
and i promise , i won 't dig up any of those other dead bodies .
we 'll just find some other way to solve this thing .
deal .
but i 'm holding you to that .
oh , and , here , i almost forgot
a , uh , coun@@ ter@@ offer on a house that you are apparently bi@@ d@@ ding on was faxed to my office .
looks like it 's more than the asking price .
what ?
um , [ clea@@ rs throat ] chief ...
what would you like me to do with these ?
i mean , they 're obviously a dead end .
uh , lieutenant tao , isn 't arsenic a hea@@ vy metal ?
which means it would show up on a che@@ m screen of cremated remains .
right , so , want to have those ashes analy@@ zed a@@ sa@@ p , please ?
thank you .
[ knock on door ] chief , got a minute ?
seems the old guy did try rea@@ ching out to us for help .
thank you .
after recei@@ ving nu@@ mer@@ ous le@@ tters to the department , " detective gordon was di@@ sp@@ at@@ ched to question the compla@@ in@@ ant , donald baxter .
according to that report ,
gordon found baxter un@@ cooper@@ a@@ tive .
in fact , the old guy was more interested ...
in asking questions than ans@@ wering them .
it seemed like a c@@ rank ,
so detective gordon du@@ mped his complaint in the r@@ ound file .
i 'm sorry -- the r@@ ound file ?
the trash .
but you know what , chief ?
we get this kind of stuff all the time .
it 's hard enough staying on top of the cri@@ mes we find ,
much less the ones people make up .
and the guy was -- come on , you know .
i know exactly what happened .
mr. baxter 's old and difficult ,
and because of that , he was dis@@ missed out of hand .
and i know that that 's what happened ,
because that 's exactly what i 've been trying to do to him myself .
but we didn 't just du@@ mp a complaint in the trash ...
a few more human be@@ ings went with it .
thank you .
were you close with mr. kaplan ?
i am close with all our residents .
oh , so you remember these folks , then ?
oh , mrs. rob@@ er@@ ts -- she was a s@@ weet lady .
she always talked about her late husband .
she used to say he had a great head of hair .
and then she started to forget she 'd ever been married .
oh , poor mr. he@@ p@@ f@@ ner after his daughter passed away ,
he just s@@ at and star@@ ed out the window for a whole year ...
before he died .
you cared about them .
yes. it 's my job .
getting old is scary .
some of our residents lose everything ...
family , friends , money .
they run out of life before they run out of time .
did any of these people seem sick before they died ? yes .
they all had the same dis@@ ea@@ se -- it 's called " old age . "
listen , people die at summer view .
we don 't ju@@ mp to murder as the cause .
who has access to their drugs ?
the nursing staff .
and the doctor , dr. reisen .
do you know where he is ? i 've tried to contact him .
on vacation -- ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i for a week , with his wife .
oh , you don 't think dr. reisen had nothing to do with the day @-@ to @-@ day care .
i super@@ vi@@ sed the meds .
any chance drugs get mi@@ xed up ?
we do our very best , ms. johnson ,
with patients who forget to take their meds ,
mi@@ spl@@ ace their pills ,
and sometimes , simply won 't cooper@@ ate .
do you think that mr. baxter poisoned mr. kaplan himself ?
i really don 't know .
whatever mr. baxter 's cla@@ im@@ ing ,
this nonsense that we had something to do with it ,
that 's not true .
mr. baxter burned his bri@@ dges with summer view and with his son .
wait. wait .
his son ? yes .
would you like to have a seat , sir ?
is my father dead ?
no. he 's not .
thank god .
so , what , uh , is he ab@@ sent without leave again ?
you need me to take him back to the nursing home ?
actually , uh , summer view is re@@ f@@ using to take your father back .
he 's made some acc@@ us@@ ations towards the staff .
this isn 't about the poisoning thing again , is it ?
listen , it 's nothing. dad used to be a repor@@ ter .
he 's just desp@@ er@@ ate for one more story , that 's all .
well , some of that story seems to be true .
several people at summer view may have been sli@@ pped some arsenic .
seriously ?
wait .
is -- is dad under arrest ?
should he be ? of course not .
look , he 's a nu@@ is@@ ance , that 's all .
he spent his entire career questi@@ on@@ ing people .
it 's who he is .
are you close to your father ?
why ?
you 're not , like , sugge@@ sting ...
i should take him home with me , are you ?
cause i know it sounds cold ,
but my life is just not condu@@ ci@@ ve to dealing with his bag@@ gage right now .
and when is it condu@@ ci@@ ve ?
excuse me ?
uh , according to summer view 's visitors ' log ,
which everyone has to sign in to enter ,
you haven 't dropped by to see your father in over a year .
and i was wondering if there was some reason .
what 's it to you when i see my dad ?
i got three kids , an e@@ x @-@ wife in re@@ ha@@ b .
and the last time i had the old guy over for dinner ,
he got my 11 @-@ year @-@ old son to help him get on@@ line to find pictures of people who died from c@@ y@@ an@@ i@@ de .
i don 't need that kind of crap in my life .
look , i was only asking about your father ...
to see if you had some reason to be afraid of him .
afraid of him ? i hardly know him , okay ?
he spent my entire chi@@ ld@@ hood ...
cha@@ sing after ne@@ wspaper hea@@ d@@ lines .
look , i got by without him then ,
he can get by without me now .
speaking of which , i need to go .
i left my kids with the bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter .
excuse me .
your dad 's here .
would you like to pop your head in and say " hello before you head out ?
maybe some other time .
i guess mr. baxter was right .
he has no family .
so , what do you do if you run out of friends and family and money ?
it 's a reason to kill yourself ,
but is it a motive for murder ?
look , chief , um ...
unless you 're gonna book the miserable old guy ,
i could take him home with me for the night .
it 's no problem .
your call .
treat him like a witness ...
but watch him like a killer .
gary : let me tell you something ,
i know women like doris .
she 's emo@@ tion@@ ally att@@ ach@@ ed to the house .
so a situation like this ,
you have got to do everything you can ...
to sell her on who you are .
so , in the letter that you write with the new offer ,
you don 't just ra@@ ise the price a little bit ,
you talk about the two of you as a couple .
how you see yourselves living in the house ,
ra@@ is@@ ing a family just like she did .
even throw in a picture of the c@@ at .
and you offer to help her out on the ter@@ ms .
she will ju@@ mp all over it , all right ? trust me .
gary doesn 't lie .
we help her out on ter@@ ms ?
all right , look , escrow 's one to two months .
today 's the 6@@ th .
you give our old lady a 20 @-@ day escrow .
end of the month ,
doris has your money in her hot little hands .
so do you , right ?
excuse me ?
you move another house ,
especially from someone you listed ,
and you get cash coming and going .
isn 't that right ?
maybe you had to move another un@@ it or two by the end of the month to hit your bon@@ us .
is that it ?
that 's got nothing to do with anything .
please .
gary doesn 't lie .
mm @-@ hmm .
what ? what ? where you going ?
it 's not just the visit@@ or 's log .
it 's the d@@ ate@@ s. it 's the d@@ ates !
detective san@@ che@@ z ,
may i see those death certificates again , please ?
thank you .
detective daniels , were you able to ...
track down that manager at summer view ?
jud@@ d whaley -- he 's on his way .
good .
uh , lieutenant flynn ,
if you wouldn 't mind asking lieutenant provenza to bring the suspect back in , please ?
i 'm on it , chief .
has anyone seen lieutenant -- tao !
got the che@@ m results on those ashes .
you 're gonna want to take a look .
i wi@@ ll. thank you. um ...
uh , detective daniels , if you would , please ,
bring sergeant gabriel up to spe@@ ed on summer view 's financi@@ als .
thank you .
sleep with one eye open ?
well , he had me up all hours playing yahtzee .
he 's a frea@@ k for the di@@ ce .
really ? who won ?
what 's whaley doing here ? !
just have a few things to clear up , mr. baxter .
he 'll acc@@ use me of everything .
well , we 'll see about that , won 't we ?
bu@@ z@@ z , would you please give me one of your lega@@ l pa@@ ds ?
thank you .
you keep in@@ si@@ sting there 's a story here .
you 're the repor@@ ter .
listen to what mr. whaley has to say ,
write it all down ,
and i 'll be back to talk with you in a minute .
you ready , sergeant ?
yes , ma 'am , completely ready .
mr. whaley , thank you so much for coming in .
certainly .
why don 't you have a seat ?
the reason i called you in is ,
i think it would be in everyone 's best interest ...
if you were to allow mr. baxter ...
back in your facility for a while .
are you serious ?
what 's she doing ? i can 't go back there .
sh@@ h , sh@@ h ! we need to hear this .
he really has nowhere else to go .
his family .
look , ms. johnson , there are other patients in our care ,
and if mr. baxter was poisoning people ,
well , for one thing , it 's a liability night@@ m@@ are .
i certainly understand your concern , mr. whaley ,
especially since summer view has quite a reputation to up@@ hold .
uh , two a@@ wards for state exce@@ ll@@ ence ,
three com@@ men@@ da@@ tions by the california seni@@ ors associ@@ ation ,
and eight bonuses ,
based upon your occupancy within the last year alone .
all this while co@@ ping with the extreme lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess of your residents ,
which is something that mr. baxter had in common with the seven people he claims were murdered .
and i 've noticed that not only ...
had our victims run out of money ,
but they had also , according to your visitors ' log ,
ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted their supp@@ ly of guests .
no one came to see them anymore .
that happens to many more of our residents ...
than one might like to believe .
well , here 's something a bit more unusual .
this is all that 's left of five of our victims .
the si@@ xth was lost in a family move .
this is a te@@ sta@@ ment to how ba@@ dly they were igno@@ red .
odd , isn 't it ?
people who have guests , li@@ ve. people who don 't , die .
well , the effe@@ ct of our emo@@ tions on the physical body ...
is still a my@@ ster@@ ious proce@@ ss ,
but believe it or not ,
some of these people likely passed away from depression .
i believe not , mr. whaley ,
but then , i have an advantage over you ,
because you can test for arsenic in cremated remains .
and what we have here are five contain@@ ers of poison@@ ous as@@ h .
my god .
oh , but you would never ask us to take mr. baxter back if you thought he was responsible for this .
no , i wouldn 't .
but i don 't think mr. baxter is responsible ,
because he doesn 't have a motive .
what he does have is a law@@ suit ,
because he brought these poison@@ ings ...
to summer view 's attention ,
and you attemp@@ ted to drug him with anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
well , that was dr. reisen 's diagno@@ sis .
i don 't pre@@ scri@@ be drugs .
i 'm not a doc@@ tor@@ . i 'm a manager .
the manager who collected the bonuses based on how many rooms are occu@@ pi@@ ed during the first five days of every month .
can you , uh , see a pattern de@@ ve@@ lo@@ ping here , sir ?
you see , it 's really -- it 's really quite re@@ mark@@ able ,
because all of your abandoned medicaid patients ...
they all died in the fourth week of every month ,
giving you time to re@@ book their rooms with full @-@ paying cli@@ ents from your waiting list .
why would i do that ?
well , according to your files ,
every month that summer view has an occupancy ra@@ te be@@ low 3 % , you collect a $ 2 , 5@@ 00 bon@@ us
you had eight of them last year .
now , i 'm thinking that maybe you got lucky .
and someone died natu@@ ra@@ lly on your ti@@ me@@ table .
but , still , you poisoned 7 people for under $ 20 , 000 .
sergeant .
mr. whaley , you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say ... she 's good .
yeah , she 's all right , i guess .
i ta@@ ught her most of this .
... one will be a@@ ppoin@@ ted to you by the state .
have you heard and under@@ st@@ ood these rights ?
you 're mis@@ repre@@ sen@@ ting everything .
we have warrants out as we speak to search your home ,
your office , and your car .
all i have to do is find the arsenic .
just one little p@@ ack@@ age of rough on rats ,
and it 's gonna look very bad for you .
mr. whaley , ab@@ sent your explanation ,
i 'm gonna have to arrest you on seven counts of murder in the first degree ,
which is a very different crime from mer@@ cy ki@@ ll@@ ings .
you know , nurse townsend told us ...
that these people were sick and un@@ happy .
it must have been very hard to watch them suff@@ er day after day .
they wanted to die .
there was no quality of life for these people , ms. johnson .
three of them had a form of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a and nowhere to go .
mr. kaplan , well , he was suff@@ ering from con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart dis@@ ea@@ se .
and if you 'll just -- just@@ just pa@@ use and re@@ fle@@ ct for a moment .
by cont@@ ro@@ lling the schedu@@ le@@ of when these poor people ex@@ pi@@ red .
which is all i ever did ,
making sure they didn 't die between the 1@@ st and the 5th ,
which would have been po@@ int@@ less
by man@@ ag@@ ing their deaths ,
i was able to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the value of their pa@@ ssing
by crea@@ ting room for people
who could better ben@@ ef@@ it from our service .
people with lar@@ ger bank ac@@ counts .
look , i 'm not the person who turned old age into a business .
and honestly , the bonuses i recei@@ ved , as you poin@@ ted out , were very small .
mr. whaley ...
you poisoned these people .
well , that 's one way of looking at it , yes ,
but , really , who car@@ es ?
their families obviously don 't .
these old people were dead already .
all i did was make it offic@@ ial .
and by doing it my way , everybody got what they wanted .
so i repe@@ at -- who car@@ es ?
unfortunately for you -- mr. baxter .
well , you have a point there .
so , how about this ?
i will re@@ fra@@ in from expe@@ d@@ iting the termin@@ al p@@ ha@@ se of any future re@@ sident 's stay at summer view ,
and mr. baxter can come back and stay with us ...
for as long as he likes .
and if he agre@@ es not to su@@ e ,
we 'll give him a year for free .
while that is a very generous offer , mr. whaley ,
if i didn 't arrest you on seven counts of murder in the first degree , which is what i 'm doing right now .
what ?
but why are you ...
i @-@ i just explained to you .
now , now , hold on one moment !
i thought you said mer@@ cy killing and first @-@ degree murder ...
were very different cri@@ mes !
they are , but the puni@@ shment for both is exactly the same .
are you actually talking about putting me in prison ?
don 't worry .
it 's not that different from summer view , really .
you have to sign in to visit people ,
friends and rela@@ tives t@@ end to forget you exist ,
and at some point , the state of california might just put you out of your misery .
well , i certainly don 't deserve this .
you 're right , mr. whaley .
unfortunately ...
did you write it all down ?
well , you gave me an ex@@ clusi@@ ve .
i didn 't know if i had another story in me .
at least , this way ,
people will read bernie 's ob@@ itu@@ ary , won 't they ?
provenza : well , i 'm sure they will , mr. baxter .
would you like us to ar@@ ran@@ ge someplace for you to go ,
or would you like money for a hotel room ?
well , really , i was hoping i could go back to summer view .
what ?
well , i don 't have to worry about being poisoned anymore ,
and it really is the only home i have , ms. johnson .
oh .
and the summer view senior living cor@@ por@@ ation ...
just might feel some sense of financi@@ al ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tion .
i could wind up living there s@@ co@@ t @-@ free till the day i die .
ah , the golden years .
rent @-@ free for the first time since i sold my house .
house .
oh , my. i almost forgot .
um , lieutenant provenza , could you please ...
i 've got it covered , chief. thank you .
here we go , mr. baxter .
and good luck , mr. baxter .
you too , young lady. thank you .
you know , if there 'd been a great @-@ looking bro@@ ad ...
doris : gary ev@@ ans dropped your letter by earlier .
i can 't be@@ g@@ in to tell you how much it means to me knowing you feel so stron@@ g@@ ly about the house .
it 's all lies .
i 'm sorry ?
in our letter , we made stuff up ...
because we wanted you to like us .
we took advantage of you ,
and it was a terri@@ ble , drea@@ d@@ ful thing to do ,
and i 'm so , so sorry .
but gary ev@@ ans ,
gary lies .
so you 're ... pulling your offer ?
it just wouldn 't feel right .
i 'd be worried about how you were spending your re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
so , yes , i 'm -- i 'm -- i 'm pulling the offer .
oh , but that 's won@@ der@@ ful , dear !
why ?
i hate to say this ,
but i was never gonna sell this house in a million years !
excuse me ?
no , that 's why i u@@ pped the price .
i didn 't think i 'd get an offer so soon in this market .
i @-@ i don 't understand .
well , when my husband died ... i was a little lonely .
it 's so difficult to meet people in lo@@ s ang@@ el@@ es .
i tried going to a. a. for a little while ,
but it turns out you have to quit drinking completely ,
which seemed extreme .
so you put your house on the market ...
... to have a little company , yes .
nothing ?
i said i 'm sorry , i 'm just not feeling too hot
you 're s@@ nee@@ z@@ ing. you can do that in a mo@@ vie thea@@ t@@ re .
it 'll be a nice so@@ ft chair when i collap@@ se@@ d. i 'm babe oh , come on ! we 're gonna be late !
e@@ pi@@ so@@ de four never comes to the big screen .
this is the p@@ re @-@ lu@@ ca@@ s @-@ ized ver@@ sion , remember ?
none of that gre@@ e@@ do shooting first crap .
go without me
what are you talking about ? you love star war@@ s
don 't you
since when ?
since just before i pretending i loved it
i 'm sorry. i 'm just trying to be suppor@@ tive .
fine. i 'll go alone .
baby i 'm sorry .
me too. i 'm so woo@@ z@@ y. i can hardly think .
we 're han@@ ging at home
you should go
did you just feel something ?
feel ? like what ?
is there ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ?
in new jersey ?
oh god -@@ what ?
i think i 'm like hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ating .
call 911
two surger@@ ies for multiple f@@ rac@@ tures and bur@@ ns .
i 'm thinking the broken bones are a respon@@ se to the building falling on her head .
and the fever ?
she 's the only collapse victim whose body temper@@ ature
put her on anti@@ py@@ re@@ c@@ tics .
already ha@@ ve. the fever is holding at 1@@ 0@@ 4 .
flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating consci@@ ous@@ ness .
i can 't take the ca@@ se. i don 't have a team .
so hire a team . - what for ? i don 't have a case .
have you even inter@@ vie@@ wed anybody ?
you test drive a car before you buy it .
you have sex before you get married , i can 't hire a team based on a ten @-@ minute interview .
what if i don 't like having sex with them ?
you 've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing .
concert is over .
in what twisted uni@@ verse does ma@@ ster@@ ing e@@ d@@ die van ha@@ len 's two @-@ han@@ ded ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ o tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e count as absolutely nothing ?
take the case or you will spend the next month helping the collapse team change ban@@ da@@ ges .
i diagno@@ se her. alone .
by the end of the day , you go away for a week .
done .
it 's not gonna work .
if he sol@@ ves the case , we cu@@ re the girl .
and prove he doesn 't need a team .
he 's not gonna solve the ca@@ se. not that fast .
why not . - because he needs a team !
and this 'll prove to him@@ - - you wanna change his mind about something , you need a more convincing argument than you promised .
fever .
non @-@ responsi@@ ve to anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tics and anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics .
flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating consci@@ ous@@ ness .
go !
you talking to me ?
yes .
imagine that the roof of the stor@@ age clo@@ set collap@@ ses on your favorite floor buffer .
which then star@@ ts over@@ hea@@ ting .
why would i have a favorite floor buffer ?
okay .
maybe the elec@@ tri@@ cal works got b@@ ang@@ ed up in there from stuff falling on it .
hmm , interesting .
brain damage lea@@ ding to hy@@ po@@ th@@ ala@@ mi@@ c dy@@ s@@ re@@ gu@@ lation .
nah .
if you 're brought in covered in ru@@ bble , it 's all about the mri 's .
we 'd have seen that. come on !
you gotta ear@@ n that fi@@ ver .
or stuff lea@@ ked in the holes , me@@ ssing it up .
l@@ ac@@ er@@ ations leave multiple por@@ tals for infection .
b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial would have respon@@ ded to the anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tics .
too high for vi@@ ral .
par@@ as@@ ites or fun@@ gu@@ s is possible .
or maybe lupus .
my grand@@ ma has lupus .
okay , au@@ to@@ im@@ mu@@ ne@@ . i 'll run a lupus panel .
infection fits best .
complete history would be help@@ ful .
which lea@@ ds to the worst part of the job .
dealing with the floor buffer 's family .
we talked every couple of weeks , but ben would know better than i
no far@@ ms , no travel anywhere weird .
you get that , dr. buffer ?
no travel , no farm .
the file says she was sick before the building collap@@ sed .
i figured it was just a cold .
why , do you think 's related ?
her being sick and her being sick ?
often is .
she was unconscious when i found her .
we 'd been fi@@ ghting .
i just want to .
just tell me she 's gonna be okay .
i 'm not even sure you 're gonna be okay .
we 're gonna make her all better .
show@@ off .
you ou@@ ght@@ a be nic@@ er to people .
where are we going ?
you know how the laughter of little children is infe@@ c@@ ti@@ ous ?
well , par@@ as@@ ites and fun@@ g@@ i are even more so .
we 're gonna find out which one is making her brain bu@@ bble over .
where , the building ?
e@@ p@@ a 's doing that job for us. they say it 's clean .
which means we 're making a pi@@ l@@ gri@@ mage to cast@@ le black@@ ber@@ ry .
her name 's bradbury .
i should ask them for ke@@ ys . - no need .
i 'm sure we can find a large ro@@ ck somewhere .
i 'm not breaking in to somebody 's house .
i got princi@@ pl@@ es .
i got some loose change here says you don 't .
i 'm not doing this .
for less than a 50 .
where 's the restaurant ?
what restaurant ?
the one you said you were taking me to for lunch .
oh , uh , this one 's ho@@ mi@@ er .
di@@ bs on the cold pi@@ z@@ za .
i 'm sure it looked easier on you@@ tube .
yeah , you don 't need a team .
you can 't even get arrested without company .
you 're right. only one solution .
never re@@ place them. ever .
do you need help ?
yeah , yeah , pat@@ ron@@ i@@ ze the poor cri@@ pp@@ le .
let me get that . - i got it .
will you@@ --@@ let me just let me get it .
i 'll check the be@@ d@@ room .
some interesting mo@@ ld on the windo@@ w@@ si@@ ll here !
it 's gonna take me a while .
i 'll cover the ba@@ th@@ room .
she had a secret diary .
is there any other kind ?
what are you doing ?
there 's a sa@@ le on liquid ti@@ de .
if you 're broke , i can l@@ end you a tin@@ y bit of the money i owe you .
no , no , i wouldn 't put you in that position .
what does the diary say ?
it 's basically a list of her sexual en@@ coun@@ ters .
boys , girls , vi@@ bra@@ ting app@@ li@@ ances .
if it was , you 'd be quo@@ ting , not su@@ m@@ mar@@ i@@ zing .
this is a parade of sa@@ d ban@@ ali@@ ties .
i can hardly get out of bed .
feeling blue .
then , three months ago , turns into a parade of happy ban@@ ali@@ ties .
starting to turn the corner .
job 's looking up .
we can stop s@@ wa@@ b@@ bing .
her cli@@ ch@@ é@@ s are getting hea@@ l@@ thi@@ er .
or she 's less depressed .
aren 't there pills that do that ?
antidepressants don 't cause fever .
not on their own .
but the e. r. didn 't know she was on m. a.o. inhibitors , so they gave her de@@ mer@@ o@@ l .
it 's a na@@ st@@ y com@@ b@@ o .
so all you have to do is convince this kid that his girlfriend had a secret doctor , and a secret st@@ as@@ h , and a secret life .
it 's been a while since a patient took a swing at you. can i watch ?
i only have to convince the mother .
actually .
i don 't have to convince anyone .
this it total crap .
if she was seeing a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ rist , i 'd know .
if she was on drugs , i 'd know .
mrs. bradbury , please sign the form so we can start the dialysis .
but why antidepressants ? i don 't understand !
mrs. bradbury , please sign the forms so we can start the dialysis .
stop saying that .
dr. buffer , what is going on ? what aren 't you telling us ?
he 's a j@@ an@@ it@@ or ?
more signific@@ an@@ tly , a bl@@ ab@@ ber@@ mouth .
house , shut up !
i am very sorry how dr. house handled this .
it is completely unfor@@ gi@@ v@@ able .
except if he 's right .
dialysis will fi@@ l@@ ter her blood .
there 's nothing to fi@@ l@@ ter .
save her life .
she wasn 't depressed .
i 'm miserable around ben .
not me. i like ben .
fe@@ bru@@ ary 1@@ 2@@ th .
either she 's depressed , or she just thinks you 're a jer@@ k .
neither suggests that you should be the one dire@@ cting her medical treatment .
does the diary say my daughter 's taking these drugs ?
no , but medica@@ lly@@ - - did you find drugs in their home ?
she 's probably hiding them in her purse .
i thought it would be rude to go sear@@ ching under 1 , 000 t@@ ons of ru@@ bble .
this was months a@@ go. we were in a fight .
it doesn 't mean she 's depre@@ s@@ se@@ d. and it doesn 't mean she doesn 't love me .
fine , maybe the diary pro@@ ves nothing .
on the other hand , half the country 's on antidepressants .
and it fits her symp@@ tom@@ s perfe@@ ctly .
no ring on your daughter 's finger means you make the deci@@ si@@ ons .
i 'm not sure that i know her well enough anymore .
you really wanna risk her life on how well he knows her ?
i have your guit@@ a tell no one a@@ wait my in structions
wilson , you i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
listen care@@ fully , and no one will get hurt .
you must follow these in@@ structions .
any attemp@@ t to contact the f. b@@ .@@ i .
or other law en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment agen@@ ci@@ es or cu@@ tty .
will be met with .
and a large co@@ k@@ e. no ice .
give it back .
what happened ?
did some@@ one. kidna@@ p your guitar ?
a $ 12 , 000 19@@ 6@@ 7 flying v ? or something ?
where 'd you hide it ?
i 'm fla@@ tt@@ ered you would consider me this bo@@ ld and brilliant .
no , ' cause it takes a cr@@ i
it takes a criminal ma@@ ster@@ mind to pull off a he@@ ist from an un@@ lo@@ cked , un@@ gu@@ ar@@ ded room down the hall .
what do you want ?
me ? nothing .
but i 'm sure the kidnapper wants what every kidnapper wants .
to see you interview five to seven well @-@ quali@@ fied fell@@ ow@@ ship can@@ di@@ d@@ ates .
i don 't need a team .
you were b@@ oun@@ c@@ ing ideas off a j@@ an@@ it@@ or .
and solved the case !
i 'm dr. cu@@ ddy .
if you can hear what i 'm saying , b@@ link once .
you can 't talk right now. you have a tube down your throat .
and try not to move your head .
you 've been in a terri@@ ble accident .
but it looks like you will have no per@@ man@@ ent injuries .
you 've had a bad fever , but it 's gone now .
i 've been here the whole time , honey , okay ? i 'm not leaving .
this is very important .
i need you to b@@ link one for yes , twice for no .
were you seeing a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ rist ?
were you on m. a.o. inhibitors ? the antidepress@@ ant .
megan , it 's okay. it doesn 't matter , okay ? i love you .
honey ? honey , what 's wrong ?
megan , are you all right ?
what 's happening ? are we up@@ se@@ tting her ?
heart is bea@@ ting too fast .
get the family out of here . - megan ?
megan ? - char@@ ging to 200 .
clear !
we sho@@ cked her back into s@@ in@@ us r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , but she 's still tac@@ hy@@ car@@ di@@ c .
fa@@ sc@@ in@@ ating .
e@@ qu@@ ally fa@@ sc@@ in@@ ating is .
why are you here ?
i was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet .
but you lost .
i explained the fever .
which is all we were talking about .
she confirmed the antidepressants .
go bet with someone else if you want to explain the heart problems .
she confirmed them by win@@ king .
maybe there was a cute guy across the room .
she got better when i trea@@ ted her .
even i 'm not that cute .
two un@@ related symp@@ tom@@ s , just a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence .
or you 're gra@@ sp@@ ing at stra@@ ws to avoid ad@@ m@@ itting you can 't do this on your own .
fine , what expla@@ ins the fever and per@@ si@@ stent tac@@ hy@@ car@@ di@@ a ?
could be any@@ thing. en@@ do@@ car@@ d@@ it@@ is .
no@@ pe. fever , no infection .
keep going , you 're doing great .
you win .
i don 't believe you . - i 'm not gonna play this game .
just give me the damn re@@ su@@ mes .
and my guitar .
i don 't have it .
al@@ though i did hear some .
pl@@ ang@@ ent stru@@ mming from under that cou@@ ch earlier .
this kidnapper isn 't just bo@@ ld , he 's di@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ cal .
i guess he reali@@ zed he probably shouldn 't give it back to you until after you 've had the inter@@ vie@@ ws .
huh , you didn 't write anything .
so what you 're saying is , you didn 't find that one big explanation .
cause there isn 't one .
cle@@ ver .
well , let 's just say .
your antidepress@@ ant theory does explain the fever .
what about the heart ? and don 't say a building fell on her .
okay .
a struc@@ ture collap@@ sed . - shut up come on , it fits .
h@@ ed mus@@ cu@@ la@@ ture relea@@ ses po@@ ta@@ ssi@@ um , causes v @-@ ta@@ c .
you 'd think sh@@ d syndrome after she was crushed , not two days later .
m@@ ic@@ ro@@ va@@ sc@@ u@@ la@@ r oc@@ clusi@@ ons .
takes that long for the blood to re@@ per@@ f@@ use .
she 'd have a bag@@ gy heart .
e@@ ch@@ o it to confirm .
is crush syndrome good or bad ?
does it sound good ?
i mean , com@@ pared to the other things it could be .
there are no other things it could be .
then why are you testing her ?
exce@@ llent question .
what@@ . what is it ?
the heart 's fine .
why is she s@@ weating ?
her fever 's back .
why would her fever be back ?
i can 't say .
you don 't know ?
i know , i just can 't say .
cause you 'll hit me .
let 's discus@@ s this in front of witnesses .
the d@@ t 's ?
so she 's an alcoholic now ?
her first fever was from the medication for her depression .
or you 're wrong .
the second fever was from the self @-@ medication for depression .
this is insane .
you don '@@ think i would have noticed her being con@@ stantly drunk ?
you were prac@@ tically living with sy@@ l@@ vi@@ a pla@@ th .
you didn 't notice that .
t@@ one it down or i will hit you .
fine , i 'll do li@@ ver en@@ zy@@ me te@@ sts .
li@@ r zy@@ mes can also be elev@@ ated from mus@@ cu@@ lo@@ sk@@ ele@@ tal trauma .
they 'd be there whether she had a drinking problem or not .
they don 't know that .
just pre@@ t@@ end to confirm .
what 's the treatment ?
she 's not an alcoholic .
hair of the dog , iv alcohol .
ta@@ per it off after a few days .
she 's sick and trau@@ ma@@ ti@@ zed and half @-@ dead .
you wanna make her drunk .
just do it .
you can 't do this .
we lived together , we were gonna have kids .
you barely even know her .
apparently , neither did you .
hello ?
hi , could i speak to tre@@ vor@@ .@@ ka@@ u@@ f@@ man ?
yo yo , it 's tre@@ v@@ . what up ?
this is dr. gre@@ g@@ ory house .
can you come in tomorrow to interview ?
house ? are you serious ? a@@ wesome !
hey , dude , i got the house interview !
oh , look at me !
i got the house interview !
dude , shut up ! i 'm on the phone !
shut up ! - i 'm so cool !
give me the phone back. give me the phone back !
i got a page .
no , you didn 't .
they called a code .
no , they didn 't .
you got a page , but not from us .
did you ever see raid on en@@ te@@ b@@ be ?
yeah , in the end , they relea@@ se the ho@@ sta@@ ges .
how 's that working for you ?
the u@@ gan@@ d@@ ans pla@@ yed fair .
they didn 't move the ho@@ sta@@ ges on the is@@ ra@@ el@@ is .
once again , i am in a@@ we of the kidnapper 's tac@@ tical brilli@@ ance .
what is el fu@@ e@@ go de@@ l am@@ or and why do you need ten of them ?
it 's a t@@ el@@ ano@@ v@@ ela .
i 'm learning sp@@ an@@ ish .
say a@@ di@@ os .
are you er@@ as@@ ing my tiv@@ o ?
house , not the sea@@ son fin@@ a@@ le .
i don 't negoti@@ ate with terrorists .
i smoke them out of their hid@@ ey @-@ holes .
do you know what terrorists do when you don 't negoti@@ ate ?
they terrori@@ ze .
bring it on .
fever 's down .
s@@ weating has ab@@ ate@@ d. heart 's working fine .
i guess house was right. again .
that 's good news , right ?
it is good news .
so what does this mean , she 's an alcoholic ?
there 's no other explanation ?
no , sorry .
it doesn 't make any sense .
dr. cu@@ ddy. she 's doing this thing with her mouth again .
it 's been on and off for the last couple hours .
is she trying to talk ?
no .
i think she 's screaming .
morning !
where did you come from ?
ap@@ es , if you believe the de@@ mo@@ cra@@ ts .
i heard you were there when i was proven right .
the alcohol treatment took away the heart and fever problems .
yes , i was also there when you were proven wrong .
she 'd been sil@@ ently screaming for two hours .
a@@ my@@ la@@ se and li@@ pa@@ se are through the roof .
she has pancreatitis .
iv alcohol can cause pancreatitis .
okay .
you 're not gonna argue with me ? - nope .
you think i 'm right ? - nope .
why not ? - nope .
it 's not really a yes or no question .
which is why i 'm not ans@@ wering it .
if it 's not the iv alcohol , it 's gotta be@@ - - not interested .
if i 'm wrong , she 's gonna die .
are you sure you 're still dea@@ n of medi@@ c@@ ine .
i 'm not interested in argu@@ ing because i 'm not interested in enabling you .
you need someone to b@@ oun@@ ce ideas off of .
you need a team .
don 't follow me .
m. a.o. inhibit@@ or caused the fever .
alcohol caused the pancreatitis .
alcohol with@@ dra@@ wa@@ l caused the v @-@ tac@@ h. le .
your lo@@ gic is ir@@ re@@ fu@@ table .
you 're wrong .
well , who are you gonna believe ?
a cla@@ ssi@@ c toy or a woman who , if she had any confi@@ dence in her ideas , wouldn 't feel the need to dist@@ r@@ act you with a water bra ?
are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis ?
are you here to en@@ able me ?
i don 't want her to die because you 're stu@@ b@@ born .
wow , so you can en@@ able and ra@@ tion@@ ali@@ ze at the same time .
guess you are still dea@@ n of medi@@ c@@ ine .
if you 're right , then this guy , who 's not an ass , who 's not a wor@@ ka@@ ho@@ lic , who 's not a soci@@ op@@ ath , has some@@ how missed both her depression and se@@ v@@ ere alcoho@@ li@@ s@@ m .
yes , imagine that , a couple with secre@@ ts .
why would she lie ?
okay , alcoho@@ li@@ s@@ m you don 't wanna ad@@ verti@@ se .
but ...
if you 're right , there 'd be an ab@@ norma@@ lity on the pancrea@@ s .
at least do an mri to confirm .
oh , my god .
this guy means business .
or guys. could be multiple guys .
or a g@@ al@@ . who knows ?
all i can say is , this re@@ e@@ ks of bo@@ ld@@ ness .
i am not hi@@ ring a team .
you ever ti@@ ght@@ en a guitar st@@ ring really , really s@@ low@@ ly ?
past the point it can handle the stra@@ in ?
it makes this weird sound .
almost like a sc@@ rea@@ m .
i thought this was gonna be fun .
i messed with you , you messed with me .
eventually , you give in .
but you 've shown a star@@ t@@ ling lack of humor , which got me thinking .
oh , god .
what 's the real reason you won 't hire a team ?
i told you , i don 't need a team .
then hire three people and let ' em sit on their asses .
that wouldn 't be right .
three years ago , you hired a tea@@ m. what 's changed ?
i have become a man of princi@@ ple .
i 've gotten smarter .
what answer will make so@@ cra@@ tes shut up ?
what 's changed is , you connected with a team .
you worked with a team .
and you lost a team .
damn .
there 's no ab@@ norma@@ lities in her pancrea@@ s .
you fall in love , you get married .
50 % chance it 'll end in misery .
hi@@ ring employees can be even tou@@ gh@@ er .
because you know , eventually , they 're gonna leave .
there 's inc@@ rea@@ sed t@@ 2 sig@@ nal on her he@@ pati@@ c cap@@ su@@ le .
if you know what i mean .
you got hurt .
get over it .
now , if you 'll excuse me , my patient is about to start bleeding out of her mouth and an@@ us .
internal bleeding .
not anymore .
now it 's all over the place .
why are you here ?
that 's my patient down there .
you 're here because i 'm here .
i am done enabling you .
i know .
the alcohol didn 't cause the pancreatitis , the internal bleeding did .
the question is , what caused the internal bleeding ?
i hate myself .
you do know that the patient had a building land on her .
four days ago .
bleeding can start at any time .
it 's bleeding from five different sit@@ es .
you think they syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ized their watches ?
she got war@@ far@@ in after her hi@@ p surger@@ y .
it 's de@@ signed to mess with bleeding patt@@ er@@ ns .
fever , heart , and bleeding .
three problems , three completely different explan@@ ations .
she must be the un@@ lu@@ c@@ ki@@ est woman in the world .
i only c@@ ling to this crazy theory because it 's been proven right every step of the way .
each treatment worked .
yes , she looks perfe@@ ctly healthy .
this much bleeding is a symp@@ to@@ m of something more .
and you need a team because you 're wrong and you 're gonna kill this woman .
if i had a team , this patient would be dead .
because they 'd be here instead of me and they wouldn 't notice the size of this woman 's uterus .
hi ! how 's it going ?
mind if i obser@@ ve ?
got a big room up top window just for that .
oh , stop that .
you wanna look at v@@ ag@@ in@@ as , there are we@@ b@@ sit@@ es for that .
think i 'm made of money ?
can you get him out of here ?
en@@ lar@@ ged uterus .
means that she was recently pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant .
she 's a good li@@ ar , but i doubt she could hide a baby from her boyfriend .
sc@@ rap@@ ing in the uterus indi@@ cates that she had an abortion .
but nothing in her medical history .
only one reason to hide an abortion .
boyfriend wants babies , she doesn 't .
she 's bleeding every@@ where .
unless the guy was perfor@@ ming an abortion with a shotgun ...
stop enabling him !
it 's not the abortion , it 's what she did after .
the boyfriend would have noticed con@@ doms .
he would notice ab@@ stin@@ ence .
he would not notice the pill .
which means , i don 't need a team !
hey , where 's your mother @-@ in @-@ common @-@ law ?
dr. house , this is dou@@ g mc@@ mur@@ try .
his girlfriend was working with megan when ...
she 's dead ?
she passed this morning .
well , then why are you still here ?
i need the old lady 's con@@ sent to do some treatment .
what 'd you find out ?
i wish i could tell you , but since you 're not legally related ...
what the hell did you find out ?
your girlfriend had an abortion .
see why i didn 't tell you ?
i 'd be insane to also tell you that she 's on the pill .
no , she 's not .
if they 'd known she was on it , they wouldn 't have given her a blood thin@@ ner after her hi@@ p surger@@ y .
the com@@ bin@@ ation caused the bleeding .
it 's good ne@@ ws. it 's trea@@ table .
just give her ta@@ mo@@ xifen .
which is norma@@ lly a brea@@ st cancer - it 's not true .
cause , uh , we wanna have kids .
huh .
see , i already did the blood te@@ sts .
and either she lied to you , or her blood lied to us .
tell megan i 'm glad she 's gonna be okay .
how are you doing ?
i got cancer .
you 're on an on@@ co@@ logy ward .
everybody 's got cancer .
you want sy@@ mpa@@ thy , you wanna try the " hardly anything wrong with the w@@ old in fact " , why don 't i take you there right now ?
how sick are you ? can you walk ?
are you a doctor ?
ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted today .
first day of a five day che@@ mo course .
yeah , you can wal@@ k. come on , let 's go .
does dr. wilson know you 're here ?
well , if he didn 't , this would be really stupid .
cause then he wouldn 't know where his patient was .
he might think he no , the room upstairs is bigger .
it 's got ca@@ ble@@ . better looking spon@@ ge bath nur@@ ses .
if you feel sick , you call me directly , not dr. wilson .
he 's getting his last set of hor@@ m@@ one shots .
you put her on ta@@ mo@@ xifen ?
an an@@ t@@ i @-@ cancer drug ?
it blocks est@@ rogen recep@@ tors .
does it also blo@@ ck breathing and kid@@ ney fun@@ ction ?
she 's cra@@ shing .
doesn 't mean i was wrong .
we 're bringing his patient over now , thanks .
anybody here a doctor ?
kid@@ ney failure , spi@@ king fever , breathing diffic@@ ul@@ ties .
any the@@ or@@ ies ?
am i in an m. night sh@@ y@@ ama@@ la@@ n mo@@ vie ?
you 're house , right ?
okay , i assume you know me because
i once in@@ sul@@ ted you , your patient , or your rela@@ tives .
if that 's so , i apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ e. i was drunk that day .
patient ini@@ tially pre@@ sen@@ ted with crush injuries .
i know you because dr. cu@@ ddy issu@@ ed a memo .
telling to cooper@@ ate fully with me ?
nope .
i figured that was a long shot .
anybody here not get that memo ?
fun@@ gal infection .
don 't you have a patient ?
she shot herself in the le@@ g while high on me@@ th .
wouldn 't hurt her to be in pain for a little while .
fun@@ gal infection would be in her eyes by now .
ha@@ emo@@ phy@@ l@@ us .
doesn 't explain the re@@ m@@ itting fever .
you 've heard ... that i 've got a job opening , right ?
i just care about people .
acute re@@ spira@@ tory di@@ stress syndrome .
a. r.d. s@@ .@@ doesn 't explain anything .
except the breathing .
if you care about people , you 're not getting the job .
i was ly@@ ing. crush syndrome .
doesn 't explain the breathing .
what was the problem with a. r.d. s ?
only explained the breathing .
and the crush syndrome ?
it didn 't explain the breathing .
you a f@@ an of sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
sure .
weird .
cause your eyes are lo@@ p@@ si@@ ded .
and by eyes , i mean brea@@ sts .
a. r.d. s
and crush syndrome , both rea@@ ctions to se@@ v@@ ere trauma .
why can 't she have both ?
because ...
because then there 's nothing we could do .
boy , you remind me of someone .
send me your re@@ sume .
i 'll put it on top of the pi@@ le that i 'm never gonna look at .
i couldn 't leave .
you don 't seem like the type of person who would give up on giving up .
i love her .
you love somebody .
someone who didn 't drink , who wanted to have babies .
and wasn 't miserable .
i know she lied , but ...
what are you doing ?
why are you saying these things to him ?
the woman you love doesn 't exist .
this woman is dying .
she has acute re@@ spira@@ tory di@@ stress syndrome and crush syndrome .
her body 's basically giving up .
we can keep her on suppor@@ tive dialysis and hope for the best .
never min@@ d. she has a lu@@ mp on her arm .
does that mean you 're wrong ?
that would be good news for you guys .
we 'll know after the bi@@ op@@ sy .
which patient is that ? - megan ...
house 's patient . - yep .
didn 't you get my memo ?
sure .
got both me@@ mo@@ s .
both .
and the second memo said to igno@@ re the first memo ?
yep .
seemed odd .
did an mri and ...
of course you did .
what 'd you find ?
it 's kind of frea@@ k@@ y. she 's got gro@@ wths all over the place .
she 's got tu@@ mor@@ s ?
not exactly .
the gro@@ wths are e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ma@@ s .
they are usually from allergic rea@@ ctions .
i 'm putting her on ster@@ o@@ i@@ ds .
aller@@ gy to what ? she doesn 't have allergies .
we don 't know .
unfortunately , the only drug she 's had enough of to have this kind of reaction is cep@@ ha@@ lo@@ sp@@ or@@ in .
and why is that unfortun@@ ate ?
because she was on it two months ago .
that 's what you mean , right ?
she took it for stre@@ p throat , so she can 't be allergic to it .
it would seem so .
what is this hospital doing to her ?
she has had three se@@ par@@ ate medical disa@@ sters .
and now she 's dying of an aller@@ gy she can 't possibly have !
mr. lee , i just have to check ...
sam ? are you okay ?
what are you doing here ?
i was taking a na@@ p .
where 's my patient ?
you stole my patient .
you kidna@@ pped my guitar .
give him back .
only when you give her back .
it 's a she ?
well , it 's certainly not a dude .
it 's a guitar ! you took a human being !
now who doesn 't have a sense of humor ?
i 'm mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing the guy re@@ mo@@ tely .
what are you , listening for the dist@@ ant sound of screaming ?
the nur@@ ses know to call me .
they don 't know who he is !
his name 's right there on the chart .
now go a@@ way. i 'm working .
they give him the wrong meds , who the hell knows what 's gonna happen ?
bad things would happen .
he 's in room 3@@ 1@@ 8 .
what are you-- what are you giving megan ?
megan ? nothing .
nothing ? what 's going on ? what 's wrong with her ?
her ? nothing .
then why are you giving her drugs ?
just some a@@ mp@@ he@@ ta@@ min@@ es to wake her up .
everything could be explained by her lying to you .
the antidepressants , the drinking , the pill .
until now .
now she 's allergic to something the chart says she 's not allergic to .
that 's not her lying , that 's the chart lying .
which doesn 't make s .
do you know liz masters ?
no .
that was her boyfriend who you met outside the morgue .
mm .
this is her chart .
she 's on m. a.o. inhibitors for depression .
she 's on the pill .
she had an abortion a month ago .
and she 's allergic to cep@@ ha@@ lo@@ sp@@ or@@ in .
what 's going on here ? what , are you saying this isn 't megan ?
yes .
since when ?
since right before i began pretending i loved it .
she 's the same size as megan , same bu@@ i@@ ld , same hair co@@ l@@ or .
they were both horri@@ bly in@@ ju@@ re@@ d. un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ab@@ ly .
e@@ m@@ t teams do not second guess family me@@ mbers ' iden@@ tifi@@ cations at accident scen@@ es .
no. liz died yester@@ da@@ y. this isn 't liz .
i know megan .
i know her hair .
i know her hands .
i know her sme@@ ll. oh .
what 's your name ?
oh , god !
your girlfriend never lied to you .
i did it all by myself , mom@@ my .
you talking to me ?
go away .
i did it all by myself , mom@@ my .
how 'd you know it was me ?
there 's a sc@@ ent given off by w@@ ounded , fer@@ al ca@@ ts .
you were wrong .
i got everything right .
just trea@@ ted the wrong - they had a good rela@@ tion@@ ship .
he couldn 't even identi@@ fy her .
and you were wrong about nee@@ ding a team .
she almost died .
so i almost need a team .
you were cont@@ ent with your " people are i@@ di@@ o@@ ts " theory .
but camer@@ on would never have ac@@ cep@@ ted that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life .
and as soon as you clai@@ med it was multiple condi@@ tions fore@@ man would have done anything to prove you wrong .
and then cha@@ se would have done anything to prove you right .
any one of them would have solved this days ago .
hire a team .
i don 't care how you do it .
just do it .
sometimes , i am wrong .
i have a gift for obser@@ v@@ ation .
for rea@@ ding people in situ@@ ations .
but sometimes , i am wrong .
this will be the lon@@ ge@@ st job interview of your life .
i will test you in ways that you will often consider un@@ fair , de@@ meaning , and ill@@ e@@ gal .
and you will often be right .
look to your left .
now look to your right .
by the end of six weeks , one of you will be gone .
as will 2@@ 8 more of you .
wear a c@@ up .
taxi !
come on. it 's beautiful out .
it 's freezing .
i want to walk .
oh , it 's beautiful !
who@@ o !
look ! it 's sno@@ wing !
it 's sno@@ wing .
ha@@ lie , it 's freezing outside .
we gotta go !
go@@ t@@ ch@@ a !
now you 're going to get it .
run !
owner of the dorothea ho@@ t@@ el. yep .
the wicked witch of the u@@ pper ea@@ st side .
her reputation pre@@ ce@@ des her .
that 's quite a snow scene for the dri@@ est winter on record .
it 's fiona 's ta@@ x @-@ de@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ ble gift to the city .
she does it every year .
who found her ?
couple over there was doing the mist@@ le@@ toe dance .
said the pla@@ t@@ form just gave way .
swear they didn 't know she was there .
signs of early @-@ on@@ set ri@@ g@@ or .
t. o.d ?
maybe six hours , give or take .
lo@@ ve@@ bir@@ ds called in the pla@@ t@@ form collapse about two hours ago .
so she was dead before the cast@@ le crushed her .
looks like a p@@ un@@ c@@ ture wound here .
pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tion looks dee@@ p ; could be a stab wound .
if she was stabbed , it seems odd there isn 't more blood .
i can 't believe it .
they app@@ lau@@ ding ?
they 're app@@ lau@@ ding .
i guess the question isn 't who would want to kill fiona chisolm ...
but who wouldn 't ?
the killer caught a break with these snow machines .
the hotel keeps them on 24 @-@ 7 .
they ru@@ in any chance of finding a disc@@ er@@ n@@ able foo@@ t@@ print .
chain on this looks like it was cut .
maybe from a purse ? could be .
is that a print ?
looks like it. maybe from our killer ?
l@@ - sha@@ ped dri@@ p pattern to the chest wound .
blood dri@@ p star@@ ts one direction , then changes course .
this is a du@@ mp job .
so not only do we need to find who murdered her , we need to find out where .
bus driver said he got dist@@ racted when a couple of kids were fi@@ ghting .
knock it off , you two !
ca@@ b stopped short in front of him .
driver says she came out of nowhere .
it 's the mi@@ dd@@ le of winter@@ . what 's she doing outside in her night@@ go@@ wn , with no sho@@ es on ?
running from someone , something ?
the body 's n@@ early froz@@ en .
any witnesses ?
no one saw her before the accident .
it 's as if she su@@ d@@ den@@ ly app@@ ear@@ ed out of nowhere .
where did she come from ?
you got something ?
the answer to your question .
she sli@@ d off the bus .
where did she fall from ?
wendy ? could be her name .
i 'll run it and a description through missing persons .
last name would have been nice .
crushed flo@@ wers ?
during the black plague , per@@ fu@@ med flo@@ wers were stu@@ ff@@ ed into the pock@@ ets of those who peri@@ shed ...
to mask the smell of death .
so that would make this ... " a pock@@ et full of posi@@ es .
ashes , ashes ...
we all fall down .
i checked with the bus company .
as far as they know , this bus was parked in the lot all wee@@ k@@ end .
there are no buil@@ d@@ ings ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to the pro@@ per@@ ty , so she didn 't fall there .
there 's a space between the roof and the inside ce@@ iling .
that 's why there 's no dent on the inside .
these things are like tin c@@ ans .
there 's no soun@@ d@@ p@@ roof@@ ing or in@@ su@@ lation .
yeah , well , then , why didn 't the bus driver hear her land ?
dan@@ ny , i ... i heard about the san@@ do@@ v@@ al shooting .
kid lived in your building .
his name was ru@@ ben .
kid was only ten years old .
i 'm sorry .
that look familiar to you ?
yeah , it 's the same one our vic was wearing .
wait. she was on top of the bus and inside ?
who might just be the proud owner of this baseball cap .
i 'm thinking that 's blood .
it 's too big , though , to belong to a kid or our vic .
well , then , whose hat is it ?
your scene as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment was correct .
the crush injuries didn 't ex@@ hi@@ bit bleeding .
she was dead before the house@@ - cast@@ le@@ - fell on her .
any defen@@ se wounds ?
bruise here on the wri@@ st .
most likely caused by someone tu@@ gg@@ ing on the purse stra@@ p we found .
could be looking at a robbery .
that thi@@ e@@ f went to a lot of trouble to stea@@ l a purse .
fiona wasn 't only crushed , but stabbed and burned as well .
contact burn .
any idea what stabbed her ?
wound mor@@ pho@@ logy was com@@ promised by the crush injuries .
so the offic@@ ial cause of death was stab@@ bing or bur@@ ning ?
neither .
her skin shows little evidence of freezing , which is in star@@ k con@@ tra@@ st to the condi@@ tion of her i@@ er@@ nal or@@ g@@ ans , na@@ me@@ ly h heart .
i 'm as@@ su@@ ming the stab inj@@ ur@@ y must be related , and i 'm not sure how it happened , but c. o.@@ d. is acute car@@ dia@@ c failure du@@ e to freeze trauma .
fiona chisolm died from a froz@@ en heart .
the par@@ tial print we found on fiona 's coll@@ ar@@ b@@ one
it wasn 't a fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ t. it was a no@@ se print .
a dog no@@ se prin@@ t. the dna came back can@@ ine .
specifi@@ cally , a nor@@ w@@ ich terri@@ er .
so i called the dorothea hotel , and fiona ow@@ ned a terri@@ er named otto .
nobody reported seeing the dog at the scene .
maybe it got sp@@ oo@@ ked , and ran off@@ . or was sn@@ at@@ ched .
desp@@ ite the li@@ z@@ ard skin and pla@@ tin@@ um chain ,
i don 't think this is a handle from a purse .
found traces of the pe@@ st@@ icide i@@ mid@@ ac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , com@@ mon@@ ly used as a fle@@ a repe@@ llent for pe@@ ts .
i 'm thinking this handle is from a leash .
do@@ g@@ na@@ pping ?
could be. chain looks cut .
odd thing is , there are no too@@ l marks .
trying to figure out what could have snapped a pla@@ tin@@ um chain clean in half .
that dog could have traces of our killer on him .
okay. i 'll call all the an@@ ima@@ l sh@@ el@@ ters , see if anybody picked him up .
right. in the meantime , if fiona was walking her dog when she was killed , we need to find out where that walk star@@ ted. yep .
chestnuts ! hot chestnuts !
we got hot chestnuts .
get ' em while they 're hot .
one bag , please .
there ya go. yes , well , some@@ how , as con@@ ci@@ er@@ ge , walking otto became a duty of mine .
but not last night ?
i went to go and get the dog from fiona , but she was behind closed do@@ ors screaming at some guy .
she ended up dead , and you didn 't think a hea@@ ted argument was worth repor@@ ting ?
hea@@ ted argu@@ ments were as much a part of fiona 's day as breathing .
i knocked , she sc@@ rea@@ med at me to go away , so i left .
well , where were you for the rest of the night ?
i left work at 6 : 00 , then i went to the double c@@ row pu@@ b on 3@@ 7@@ th .
i 'm there every night .
guess tonight i 'll be kno@@ cking back a few for poor old fiona .
you don 't seem very broken up over her death .
the ru@@ mor@@ s about how mean she is@@ - they 're all true .
anyone could have killed her except for me .
where 's fiona 's office ?
wicked .
b@@ rist@@ les are positive for blood .
broken b@@ room , knocked over pictures , sma@@ shed la@@ mp , it all poin@@ ts to a stru@@ gg@@ le .
so who is the guy fiona was screaming at behind closed do@@ ors ?
not keeping you busy enough , sid ?
uh , actually , your wendy in@@ spi@@ red a little research .
any of it lead to c. o.d ?
yes , well , this one 's a real cli@@ ff@@ han@@ ger .
okay , when my tech tested your vic 's body temper@@ ature at the scene , it was 7@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es .
ad@@ ju@@ sting for the extreme wea@@ ther condi@@ tions ,
i 'm esti@@ ma@@ ting she was killed eight to n@@ ine hours before you found her .
which makes time of death just after mid@@ night .
mm @-@ hmm .
and while her broken bones are consistent with the damage caused by the imp@@ act of the bus and taxi , her was caused by ex@@ san@@ gu@@ in@@ ation , du@@ e to the tr@@ an@@ se@@ cting of the right in@@ fer@@ i@@ or me@@ sen@@ ter@@ ic ar@@ ter@@ y .
b@@ led out through the ab@@ dom@@ en .
but it was the man@@ ner by which the wounds were in@@ f@@ li@@ cted that ba@@ ited my interest .
both wound trac@@ ks rev@@ ea@@ led cur@@ v@@ ature .
she was killed with a hook ?
or a hook @-@ like in@@ stru@@ ment .
from the se@@ men i found , she had sex sh@@ or@@ tly before she died .
nothing to indi@@ cate it was anything but con@@ sen@@ su@@ al .
what 's that ? a fairy .
it 's from a small red im@@ pression
i found behind her right shoulder .
any idea what caused it ?
no idea , but which brings me to my research .
a fairy ,
wendy in a night@@ go@@ wn , killed by a sharp cur@@ ved in@@ stru@@ ment .
makes one wonder ? ? ? ?
any luck iden@@ t@@ ying the vic ?
ang@@ ell checked with missing persons .
nothing that mat@@ ches our jane doe , including the name " wendy " or anything else .
based on the vic 's weight and de@@ p@@ th of imp@@ act , it appears she fell 35 feet .
it 's about a three @-@ story drop , so our pri@@ mary crime scene would be a building that 's 35 feet or high@@ er .
leaves about every struc@@ ture in man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan .
a@@ da@@ m 's proce@@ ssing the rest of the evidence .
maybe he found something that can help us n@@ ar@@ row down the search .
the name written on the vic 's chest , " wendy ,
was written in a water @-@ based ac@@ r@@ y@@ lic .
finger pa@@ int ?
and the clay that sid found under her fin@@ ger@@ na@@ ils had a mi@@ x@@ ture of whe@@ at fl@@ our , de@@ o@@ dor@@ ized k@@ er@@ o@@ sen@@ e , sa@@ lt , bor@@ a@@ x and alu@@ m@@ - otherwise known as " kid@@ die clay .
mm , starting to see a the@@ me here .
and the star that was stuck to her fore@@ head had a par@@ tial .
it was a match to a print that sid found in the finger pa@@ int .
it didn 't match the vic and there was no hits in afis .
so we got finger pa@@ in@@ ts , kid@@ die clay and a gold star , items that might be found in a kindergarten class or a toy store .
our vic was murdered and du@@ mped from 35 feet .
there 's not a lot of kindergar@@ ten@@ s or toy stores with three stories in a 20 @-@ mi@@ le radius of where our vic was found .
toy stores and schools are the last plac@@ es
i want to be looking for a killer right now .
based on the ar@@ ts @-@ and @-@ cra@@ f@@ ts trace you found on the vic ,
i did some checking .
been a ra@@ sh of kindergarten break @-@ ins .
this one just last night .
we 're on the third floor .
with a parking lot be@@ low .
big enough to par@@ k a bus .
so our per@@ p lif@@ ts a school bus from where they par@@ k the bus@@ es and then re@@ turns it with a dead body on the roof ?
looks like we got our evidence right here .
school security didn 't think it was a big deal .
a few tab@@ les and cha@@ irs were knocked over , nothing was stolen .
who brea@@ ks into a kindergarten classroom ?
same m. o. at the other schools .
per@@ p left the place a mess .
nothing was missing .
he 's been doing that a lot la@@ tely .
i didn 't know mar@@ s had sun@@ spo@@ ts .
if i remember corre@@ ctly , sun@@ spo@@ ts don 't have dire@@ c@@ tion@@ ali@@ ty@@ - dan@@ ny .
is it blood ?
yeah .
could be ca@@ st @-@ off .
killer did a good job clean@@ ing up , if that 's all he missed .
let 's find out .
based on the amount of blood ,
i 'd say we were in the right place .
got gra@@ v@@ it@@ a@@ tional blood dro@@ ps over here .
got a hi@@ dden book over here .
it 's got some hand@@ written numbers in the back and it 's not from this classroom .
it 's from the pu@@ b@@ lic li@@ br@@ ary .
think we found our murder weapon .
this make sense to anybody ?
the way i remember it ,
peter pan was about a fanta@@ sy , not about a murder .
hey , stell@@ a ... yeah ?
what do pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an and nigeria and af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an have in common ?
oh , do i really want to know ?
poli@@ o and men@@ ing@@ it@@ is , for which you get v@@ acc@@ in@@ ated when you travel to those coun@@ tri@@ es .
now , i got the results back from the blood on the b@@ room .
male , human , no hits in co@@ d@@ is , but there were anti@@ bodies in the blood , and the high le@@ vel suggests the donor was in@@ o@@ cu@@ lated with a v@@ acc@@ ine sometime in the past two weeks .
male blood .
right. now , i had fl@@ ack cro@@ ss @-@ re@@ ference a list of people who 've been im@@ m@@ uni@@ zed in the past two weeks with fiona 's known associ@@ ates .
we found a connection .
har@@ ri@@ son green , m@@ d .
he 's the f@@ oun@@ der of hear@@ t@@ sa@@ ge inter@@ national .
it 's a children 's charity , and up till now ,
fiona 's been their biggest donor , but guess what .
this year , she didn 't make a donation .
maybe dr. green tried to change her mind .
i had a meeting with fiona , but i didn 't attack her .
we were friends , good friends .
my friends don 't play b@@ roo@@ mb@@ all with my face .
i play ru@@ g@@ by. it 's a tough sp@@ ort .
dr. green , we can match every b@@ rist@@ le to every scrat@@ ch , not to mention the blood .
the woman was insane .
if she wasn 't one of my biggest don@@ ors ,
i 'd have nothing to do with her .
well , she wasn 't one of your biggest don@@ ors this year .
i wanted the money she promised me ;
us , the children of nigeria .
fiona , don 't cut us off ! let go of me !
don 't cut us off ! let go of me ...
do you always re@@ sort to physical alter@@ cations when so@@ li@@ c@@ iting don@@ ations ?
when it 's something i 'm passionate about , sure .
i have a heart .
isn 't that what charity 's all about ?
not when your charity 's fla@@ gged by the irs .
seems that a per@@ cen@@ tage of the fun@@ ds that you 're colle@@ cting to im@@ m@@ uni@@ ze children is actually going towards the con@@ struction of your lake com@@ o home .
yeah , i 'm guessing that all your tri@@ ps to nigeria were stri@@ ctly for photo op@@ s , prove you 're leg@@ it .
fiona suspe@@ cted that you were a fra@@ ud and stopped wri@@ ting you che@@ cks .
i have other inve@@ stor@@ s .
none as powerful as fiona chi@@ sho@@ l@@ m .
all she had to do was pick up the phone , call the papers and you 'd be finished .
unless you have the evidence , to arrest me ,
i think you 're finished .
any luck finding the dog ?
not yet .
but his broken leash is another story .
since i couldn 't figure out what could 've cut the leash without leaving too@@ l marks ,
i decided to take a closer look .
i found ...
a re@@ peti@@ tive pattern with a break along a single plane , which means the metal was ext@@ reme@@ ly bri@@ ttle .
like it was froz@@ en. yeah .
it 's definitely a match .
liquid nitrogen snapped the leash .
and i 'm thinking it 's also what caused
fiona 's heart to freeze .
you know , the shape and dia@@ me@@ ter of the stab wound ...
... could be consistent ...
with the nozzle of a liquid nitrogen tank .
allow@@ ing dire@@ ct access to her heart .
now , a tank nozzle is very bl@@ un@@ t , so the killer must 've used tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous force to push it all the way through fiona 's car@@ dia@@ c wall .
there are liquid nitrogen tan@@ ks on street cor@@ ners all over the city .
the uti@@ lity comp@@ an@@ ies use them to ma@@ in@@ tain power lines and redu@@ ce cor@@ ro@@ sion .
you know what else liquid nitrogen is used for ?
snow machines .
l@@ n@@ 2 , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ zed a@@ ir and water
in@@ stant winter fun .
lan@@ d@@ sca@@ pe supp@@ ly company responsible for the snow said this is where they store all the tan@@ ks they use during the week .
hey , this nozzle 's b@@ ent .
positive for blood .
looks like we found our murder weapon .
there 's something stuck to this v@@ al@@ ve .
looks like skin from a finger .
who tou@@ ches a liquid nitrogen tank without g@@ loves ?
maybe the force of fiona 's body hitting the tank caused it to fall .
the j@@ ar@@ ring would have allowed a few bla@@ sts , more than enough to kill her .
and if the nozzle was on the gr@@ ound , the l@@ n@@ 2 could 've easily rea@@ ched the leash .
so the killer got fiona .
and her little dog , too .
hey , boss .
i got some information on the baseball cap you guys found on the school bus .
hmm , blood on the bi@@ ll mat@@ ched our jane doe .
the dna from the band had shar@@ ed male all@@ el@@ es at 12 out of 1@@ 6 lo@@ c@@ i with the vic 's re@@ ference samp@@ le .
so it 's our jane doe 's brother and he 's not in our system .
what about the hat 's lo@@ go ?
it belongs to stan@@ well and lin@@ ford .
it 's a brok@@ er@@ age firm on wall street .
gentle@@ men , get this straight .
right now i have 20 inter@@ ns and only one of you is getting a job .
so if you want to get my attention , you 're gonna have to give more than 1@@ 10 per@@ c@@ ent .
first order of business is getting your asses down to the ten@@ th floor for drug testing .
nurse rat@@ ch@@ et is waiting .
now move .
mr. wright , n@@ ypd crime lab .
we 'd like to talk to you .
it 's about your sister .
your recep@@ tion@@ ist recogni@@ zed her .
her name 's leslie .
you know where leslie was last night ?
we had dinner .
left the restaurant around 10 : 00 .
leslie said she was going to a party .
i ha@@ iled her a taxi .
that was the last time i saw her .
whose party was it ?
i should 've as@@ ked. i have no idea .
did your sister have a boyfriend ?
if she did , i would 've been the last to know .
i guess that 's what you get for being an over@@ protec@@ tive big brother .
mr. wright ...
we found a baseball cap we believe belongs to you , bears your company 's lo@@ go and was found inside the same school bus where your sister 's body was found .
was leslie wearing it last night ?
not when we were together .
you have to find out who did this .
please tell me you 'll get the person who did this .
oh. hey .
that was a nice move .
what is this , d@@ anc@@ ing with the sci@@ enti@@ sts ?
no , it 's more like a w@@ u @-@ tan@@ g with a little h@@ ee@@ l @-@ toe action .
oh , yeah .
moving right along .
i used the struc@@ tu@@ ral d@@ at@@ a from the r@@ i along with the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ la@@ r weight i pulled from the g@@ c@@ ms to i. d. the pill you found in the classroom .
it 's me@@ th@@ o@@ xy di@@ i@@ so@@ pro@@ py@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ mine , also known as " foxy .
an intense high with an ab@@ rupt c@@ ome@@ down .
the la@@ test in high @-@ end de@@ sig@@ ner drugs .
makes e@@ c@@ st@@ as@@ y look like a@@ spir@@ in .
and us@@ ers claim it in@@ du@@ ces this chi@@ ld@@ like wonder .
l@@ s@@ d with a twist .
and ...
the tox results confirm that our vic had foxy in her system .
so your wendy was flying high at t. o.d .
question is , who was her co@@ pi@@ lot ?
hey , ma@@ c , i pulled a bunch of prints off the peter pan book , but nothing hit in afis , and there 's nothing that puts the brother at the scene .
but here 's that page of numbers i found in the back of the book .
now , they 're all five di@@ g@@ its .
the first two are se@@ qu@@ en@@ tial .
yeah , they 're text numbers , so , when you send a text , a few secon@@ ds later , this is what comes back to you .
ali@@ ce will see you at 11 : 30
tonight at d@@ un@@ hill .
d@@ un@@ hill is one of those pri@@ c@@ ey private kindergarten schools on the u@@ pper ea@@ st side .
but who the hell is ali@@ ce ?
so who tou@@ ches a liquid nitrogen tank without g@@ loves ?
hey , i got prints from the skin that was on the liquid nitrogen tank .
no hits in afis , so i ca@@ st a wider net .
found something in home@@ land security .
hey , our good friend tin@@ a o '@@ don@@ o@@ van , the con@@ ci@@ er@@ ge .
she enter@@ ed this country from i@@ re@@ land on a work vis@@ a three years a@@ g
spon@@ sor@@ ed by ?
the dorothea hotel .
but here 's the best part .
she was fired two days ago .
wait , so if tin@@ a was fired before fiona was killed , what made her show up for work this morning ?
when i found out fiona was gone and no one else knew that she 'd fired me ...
you figured you 'd keep working .
it made sense to me .
look , i told you
i was at the double c@@ row pu@@ b all night .
so you want to explain why your dna is on the murder weapon ?
we found a piece of your finger on the nitrogen tank .
because she told me to fi@@ x it .
the sno@@ w@@ man is me@@ l@@ ting .
it 's me@@ l@@ ting .
what am i supposed to do ?
it 's my pleasure , ms. chisolm .
ow .
look , i 've got a bra@@ in. i 'm not stupid .
i knew survi@@ ving fiona meant i could write my own ticket in this town .
why would i tea@@ r that in half ?
looks like we 're in the right place .
this party is inv@@ it@@ ation only .
left mine at home .
where 'd you get that bruise ?
oh , this .
few nights ago .
mad party .
mad .
apparently , the party 's going on 2@@ 4@@ 7 in your head .
i ... i can 't explain myself ,
i 'm afraid , sir , because i 'm not myself .
you see ?
yeah , well ...
whoever you are ...
you have the right to remain silent .
let 's go .
sorry to kill your trip , but why a kindergarten ?
it 's wi@@ ld@@ gar@@ ten , man .
that 's just another name for getting high with your friends .
look , it 's all kept under the ra@@ da@@ r .
inv@@ ites are small .
we each get a book with text numbers , tell us when and where we 're supposed to be .
the party begin@@ s .
the foxy , man ...
makes the game real .
turns man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan into neverland .
except nobody dies in neverland .
this is the weapon that was used to kill leslie wright .
and the bruise on your hand is consistent with the shape of this weapon and the amount of force that would 've been needed to kill her .
wait a minute , i didn 't kill her .
see , i got evidence that says otherwise .
i barely knew this girl .
br@@ yce , i got you for breaking and enter@@ ing .
and according to all your friends here , you were the one that stole that bus .
i had a summer job clean@@ ing school bus@@ es .
i kept some of the ke@@ ys .
i only bor@@ ro@@ wed them for a few hours .
still doesn 't explain that bruise .
look , we were just me@@ ssing around .
i was pretending with my buddy el@@ li@@ o@@ t .
i don 't know what happened to the hook after i dropped it .
somebody stuck it into leslie wright 's sto@@ ma@@ ch a couple times .
it wasn 't me. let me explain this to you in a way you might understand .
forget neverland
you got to g@@ row up and that 's going to be behind bar@@ s ser@@ ving a life senten@@ ce for murder .
this is otto ?
yes .
hi , otto .
how you doing ?
fiona couldn 't be too bad ; her dog is friendly .
where 'd you find him ?
sa@@ les@@ man at a bike shop found him in a ba@@ sk@@ et .
he was going to take him home to red hook , till he saw the news , called the precinct .
he didn 't give him a bath , did he ? nope .
for the past 24 hours , this pa@@ mper@@ ed poo@@ ch has been slu@@ mming it .
all right , otto ...
hey , guys. what do we got ?
dna from the blood on otto 's mouth came back human .
no i. d.@@ but it 's male .
now , the dog was gone for almost 24 hours .
it means the blood could belong to anyone .
what about the coll@@ ar ?
trace came back as sea@@ ri@@ c , pal@@ mi@@ tic and lin@@ o@@ le@@ ic ac@@ id .
it 's com@@ mon@@ ly found in chestnuts .
roa@@ sted to be ex@@ act .
there were also traces of char@@ co@@ al .
and the burn pattern on fiona 's ne@@ ck could be consistent with the gri@@ ll on a chestnu@@ t cart .
so that 's how fiona was trans@@ ferred from the pri@@ mary crime scene to the front of the hotel .
i had fl@@ ack pull all ven@@ d@@ or licen@@ ses .
there 's only one in the ar@@ e@@ a with a per@@ mit to sell near the dorothea .
name 's felix hall .
two weeks ago , he filed an app@@ ea@@ l .
seems someone was trying to pull his license and kick him to another corner .
let me guess : fiona .
yeah , but those are ro@@ tten , man .
just pull the top away .
that 'll be fine. yeah , it 's still good .
this is just wrong .
seriously , no new yor@@ ker should ever see this .
ever .
look , you can always put in for psy@@ ch leave .
hey , felix hall ?
n@@ ypd .
we got a couple questions to ask you , nu@@ t man .
starting with : which cart is yours ?
why ? what 's going on ?
hey , hey , wait , what do you think you 're doing ?
i just cleaned this thing .
positive for blood ...
and this looks like skin .
looks like you 've been roa@@ sting more than chestnuts in this thing , felix .
put your hands behind your back .
you 're under arrest for the murder of fiona chisolm .
you okay ?
no , i 'm not .
i don 't think i 'm ever going to be the same .
? ? ? ?
you have your cor@@ ner@@ - five feet by five feet , a king@@ dom , right ? but it m might as well be
pri@@ me spot
but then fiona deci@@ des to take it all a@@ way. what was it ?
she didn 't like the way your aw@@ ning looked , or maybe she just didn 't like the smell of chestnuts in the morning .
we got your dna off th@@ dog , felix .
did he b@@ ite you before or after you killed fiona ?
the only thing i 'm guilty of is having the cou@@ ra@@ ge to stand up to her .
ms. chisolm , please ... i need this corner .
there are hun@@ dre@@ ds of cor@@ ners in this city .
feel free to set up on any one of them but mine ... ms. chisolm , wait ...
she pushed you too far .
so you decided to push back .
hey !
you did it , felix .
and you used your cart to move the body .
and you figured between her employees and all the people in the street , there 's be too many suspects to count , right ?
the blood we found inside your cart and the skin from the bur@@ ner , it was positive for fiona 's dna .
all that woman cared about was herself .
she didn 't know what it was like for real peop@@ le. so you decided she needed somebody to put her in her place .
teaching someone a lesson only works if they 're still alive to learn it .
the dna i got off the hook wasn 't a match to br@@ yce al@@ di@@ co@@ tt .
but when i com@@ pared it to other case samples , it was a match to another donor on the hat .
which puts that hat on someone besides the brother .
maybe it was se@@ one else at the brok@@ er@@ age firm .
except we can 't just go around asking for dna samples .
we don 't have to .
the first order of business is getting your asses down to the ten@@ th floor for drug testing .
stan@@ well and lin@@ ford drug tested their employees yesterday .
all we have to do is sub@@ po@@ en@@ a the test samples for dna .
congratula@@ tion@@ s. you deserve it. good luck .
have a seat , tyler .
pretty dog @-@ eat @-@ dog world around here , huh ?
what , like out of 20 inter@@ ns only one of you guys get the job , right ?
we got some bad news .
uh , what is this , about the drug test ?
you could say that .
you tested positive .
for what ?
murder .
dna puts you with leslie wright the night she was killed .
she was high , but then , you knew that , didn 't you ?
psy@@ che@@ de@@ lic hall@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ g@@ en found in her system lo@@ wers inhi@@ bi@@ tions , makes the us@@ er more sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to sexual adv@@ ances .
so when you got her alone ,
leslie wright was yours for the taking .
we were both high .
no , no , not so much .
you see , the ri@@ o of me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ tes to par@@ ent comp@@ ounds from the drug test you took te@@ lls us you were so@@ ber .
you want to know what that means ?
you took advantage of a young woman under the in@@ flu@@ ence of a n@@ ar@@ co@@ tic .
all right , so i wasn 't high .
so what ?
the bottom line is she didn 't say no .
call it whatever you want ...
we call it ra@@ pe .
i 'm guessing so did leslie .
the drug 's effe@@ cts have a short life sp@@ an .
look , she wanted me .
then it was like she just snapped .
how could you do this to me ? ! stop ! no , stop !
no , stop ! you 're sick ! get off of me !
so what happened ?
did she th@@ rea@@ ten to go to the cops ?
or go straight to big brother ?
stop ! stop ! get off of me !
i 'm telling my brother !
get up .
do you believe this ?
fiona 's real name was lor@@ ra@@ ine ga@@ il , from to@@ pe@@ k@@ a , k@@ an@@ sa@@ s .
she left home at 1@@ 9 .
found work at the dorothea as a ma@@ id to make ends meet while she got her mb@@ a .
its employees were the only family she had .
what 's all this ?
i 'm just trying to make sense of what 's happening to me .
the way i figure , i 'm in a com@@ a somewhere or on a very intense drug trip .
maybe i 've tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed through time , or perhaps i 've , uh , cra@@ sh @-@ lan@@ ded on an alien plan@@ et , and as we speak , ex@@ tra@@ ter@@ re@@ stri@@ als are trying to har@@ vest my inte@@ lle@@ ct
i mean , such as it is .
maybe i 'm the victim of a mind experi@@ ment , or maybe i 've died and gone to heaven ...
or he@@ ll. how about pur@@ g@@ at@@ ory ? or maybe ...
i 've plain gone insane ' cause i don 't know what 's real anymore .
what 's this supposed to mean ?
that repre@@ sen@@ ts the unknown .
all things i haven 't thought of yet .
it 's the one out of all these that scar@@ es me the most .
this is for your own good .
if the lieutenant sees this , you 'll wish you could go back in time .
i can 't see her face
maya , my girlfriend in 2@@ 00@@ 8 .
i spent all last night trying to picture her smile .
i couldn 't do it no matter how hard i tried .
so maybe if i can figure all this out ...
sam , no more of this crazy talk .
i 'm trying to be a friend to you , but
okay , fair enough .
what i 'm doing in 19@@ 7@@ 3 and how to get back
i 'll figure it out on my own .
but until then , i guess i 'm left with only one op@@ tion .
and what 's that , sam ?
to spend my time here doing what it is i do best .
which is ?
cat@@ ching bad guys .
what 's the big hurry , trent ?
we just want to talk to you about an armed robbery .
you run like that , we 'll be@@ g@@ in to think you 're guilty of something , huh ?
oo@@ ps .
please , help me ! help !
what did you do that for ?
for making me run .
it 's all right. he 's dre@@ ssed for a di@@ p .
i can 't swim !
isn 't this a predi@@ ca@@ ment ?
nah , not rea@@ ll@@ y. sc@@ um bu@@ ms flo@@ at .
please ! help ! - all right .
oh , come on. you can 't be serious .
who are you working the check cashing robberies with , trent ?
i don 't know anything !
you could tell it to us , or you could tell it to the little fi@@ shi@@ es at the bottom of the lake .
bye @-@ bye .
uh , i don 't think he 's gonna come up , guys .
can 't let him dro@@ wn .
all right. get him out , chris .
oh , i can 't swim . - ray ?
nah , i took some less@@ ons when i was a ki@@ d. they didn 't stick .
un@@ believ@@ ab@@ le. chris ?
ho@@ or@@ ay !
all right , just brea@@ the@@ . you 'll be fine. just brea@@ the
what 's the hurry , mar@@ k sp@@ it@@ z ?
hey , get this guy out of here .
i miss you , maya .
you okay , sam ?
he looks like one of t@@ m car@@ to@@ on charac@@ ters , got hit over the head with a f@@ rying pan .
don 't he , loot ? - yeah , he does !
like in the funny papers .
like in the funny papers .
yeah , like in the funny papers .
my name is sam tyler .
i was in an accident , and i woke up in 19@@ 7@@ 3 .
i don 't know how or why i 'm here , but whatever 's happened , it 's like i 've lan@@ ded on a different plan@@ et .
now maybe if i can work out the reason , i can get home .
last week , three aaa money check ca@@ sh@@ g stores were rob@@ bed .
a little over $ 12 , 000 taken .
oh , a tast@@ y ha@@ u@@ l .
and best of luck to ' em , whoever they are .
three bodies were found , one at each store
hey , looks like she was cute ...
before she put on the dead chi@@ ck mask .
alonzo de sou@@ za and den@@ n@@ is ma@@ gui@@ re .
all shot , and that 's no small thing considering they were tu@@ cked s@@ nu@@ g behind bu@@ lle@@ t@@ proof gla@@ ss with no witnesses , no sign of for@@ ced en@@ try .
yeah , that 's , uh , that 's very cool .
hey , listen , any chance i 'm gonna get sp@@ run@@ g any@@ time soon ?
you know , " lau@@ gh @-@ in " is on tonight , and ...
i got it bad for that go@@ l@@ die ha@@ wn .
we know you 're involved , trent .
no one loves hitting check cashing stores like you and your monkey squad .
so who were you mee@@ tin ' at the poo@@ l ?
i was mee@@ tin ' my a@@ un@@ t doris .
you know , you 're just her type .
no , seriously .
i should give her your number .
you could be my uncle gene .
uncle gene ?
hey , that 'd be perfe@@ c@@ t. why don 't we prac@@ ti@@ ce ?
say it , you filthy sc@@ ro@@ te. you want me to stop ? say it .
uncle ! uncle ! uncle ! uncle .
not bad .
what is someone who can 't swim doing at la@@ sk@@ er poo@@ l , trent ?
well , it 's never too late to start .
learning the back@@ stro@@ ke ain 't a crime , is it ?
we found this on you when we pulled you in .
could this be your cut of the aaa money jo@@ bs ?
or you just need a little pa@@ d@@ ding in your swim trun@@ ks ?
yeah , that ain 't my sc@@ rat .
if it was , wouldn 't it be w@@ et ?
you were saying ?
what is it , june ?
assi@@ stant district attorney crocker is here .
fine. throw this pi@@ le of pus back in the cage .
oh , no , come on , man. that cell sme@@ lls like vomit .
oh , i can help you with that .
what was that ?
that money isn 't from the check cashing robberies .
yeah , and ro@@ e v@@ s. wa@@ de ain 't really two op@@ tions when you find yourself in a ri@@ ver .
what does that even mean ?
that 's an analogy .
uh , no , i don 't think it is .
it 's like an analogy .
where i come from , what you did is called " ta@@ mper@@ ing with physical evidence ,
and it 's a class " e " fel@@ on@@ y .
where you come from ? where is that , hyde ?
where guns are made of g@@ ing@@ er@@ brea@@ d , and criminals confe@@ ss for lo@@ lli@@ po@@ ps .
do you have any evidence lin@@ king trent to the robberies ?
well , well , well. aren 't you the eager bea@@ ver ?
now that was an analogy .
no , that was just ob@@ no@@ xious .
ah , what 's a guy gotta do to get an analogy in thi@@ so@@ int , huh ?
if we have the evidence , we 'd be able to charge him by now , right ?
that 's a lot of questions for a secretary .
there he is@@ -- the golden re@@ tri@@ ever of the district attorney 's office .
thank you , no @-@ nu@@ ts .
lee , this is the trans@@ fer from hyde i told you ab@@ out@@ -- sam tyler .
sam , this is lee crocker .
not only does he know where all the bodies are bu@@ ried , he knows the sho@@ vel si@@ zes .
welcome ab@@ o@@ ard , tyler .
like two pea@@ s in a p@@ ans@@ y po@@ d .
detective , if ig@@ nor@@ ance was a drug , you 'd be high all the time .
now that was an analogy .
i took a look at the file , gene .
the f. c@@ .@@ c. has a better case against ge@@ or@@ ge car@@ li@@ n and his seven dirty words than you have against kim trent .
i agree .
we have no evidence to secu@@ re a con@@ vic@@ tion .
give us a second , lee .
detective tyler and i need a moment .
of course .
you want evidence ?
ala@@ dd@@ in 's ca@@ ve .
what the hell is that ?
there 's 3@@ 00 m@@ ic@@ ro@@ do@@ ts of l. s. d.@@ here .
we pl@@ ant ' em on kim trent and watch him g@@ row into a big flo@@ wer of justice .
that 's just ... great .
i de@@ te@@ ct s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m .
how would you do it where you come from ?
we wouldn 't have pulled him in without evidence .
even if you knew there were people out there in real dan@@ ger ?
people are always in dan@@ ger .
one minute , you 're going about your busine@@ ss. the next ... ban@@ g !
you 're taken out by a speeding car .
well , i 'm taking a speeding car off the road .
so what do you wanna do ?
we give him a desk app@@ ear@@ ance ticket , we cut him loose , but we stay on him .
we follow him , see where he takes us , get some real evidence so we can put him away for good .
that 's your an@@ g p@@ l ?
yeah , that 's my big plan .
fine. cut him loose .
but whatever happens next is on your head .
you and ray stay on tr@@ en@@ t. anywhere he goes , you guys go. got it ?
sure thing .
we 'll re@@ lieve you in the morning . - okay .
i don 't know if ray 's gonna go for that plan . - why not ?
he doesn 't r@@ lly , u@@ h@@ -- - he doesn 't like me .
no . - no , i know .
no , the loot put him in for a pro@@ motion to second grade , and then you show up .
he@@ --@@ he just feels like you took his spot .
but i wouldn 't take it personal .
yeah , well , i didn 't re@@ quest this trans@@ fer .
it just happened .
it 's like gu@@ an@@ t@@ na@@ mo b@@ ay in here .
oh , i wouldn 't know. i 've never been to pu@@ er@@ to ri@@ co .
kim trent , here is a d. a.@@ t. you are free to go .
you gotta respect those who defend the con@@ st@@ itu@@ tion .
all ha@@ il the ni@@ x@@ on ad@@ min@@ i@@ stra@@ tion .
yeah , don 't get too att@@ ach@@ ed .
are you okay , sir ?
did you just see that ? - was it a rat ?
the rats are big in this house , sir , but they 're har@@ m@@ less mostly .
i cleaned out that cell .
it sme@@ lled of vomit .
he was right. it did stin@@ k to high heaven .
well , i 'm sure the , uh , the next prison@@ er will appreciate your ef@@ for@@ ts .
it 's all love and light here at the , uh , 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 .
in other music news , in honor of mother 's day , el@@ v@@ is pres@@ ley will be perfor@@ ming a special concert in lake ta@@ ho@@ e at the ta@@ ho@@ e sa@@ har@@ a in me@@ mor@@ y of his mother , gla@@ d@@ ys pres@@ ley
you must be 2b .
i 'm windy . - windy .
now that 's an unusual name .
my father named me windy because he was a sa@@ il@@ or and wind was his gold .
i 'm sa@@ m. what ?
your f@@ ate lin@@ e@@ -- it 's bi@@ se@@ cted !
is that a good thing ?
it can be .
it 's like a record s@@ ki@@ pping .
you 're listening to one song , the nee@@ d@@ le gets bu@@ mped , and you 're g@@ roo@@ ving to a whole new tu@@ ne@@ . what 's up there ?
well , um , ther@@ e@@ --@@ for star@@ ters , no na@@ ked women .
are you new to new york ?
you could say that . - it 's an ad@@ just@@ ment .
i get home@@ sick all the time for de@@ cor@@ ah , i@@ ow@@ a .
lot of people , a lot of love back there .
i know the feeling .
i used to spend hours just flo@@ ating in an inner tube , looking up at the clouds .
you and me , we stay in one place , but the clouds go every@@ where .
so sometimes i 'd ask them to car@@ ry a message back to de@@ cor@@ ah for me .
i imagine there 's someone flo@@ ating in a lake , looking up at the same cl@@ oud , sending me their love , too .
hey , do you like to dance ? because i love to dance !
not really . - oh , great .
well , then we 'll have to dance . - okay .
i 'll see you around , 2b .
2 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 to centra@@ l k , we are app@@ ro@@ ach@@ ing trent 's apartment .
where are chris and ray ?
2 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 to centra@@ l k .
proce@@ ed , 2 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 .
we 're outside kim trent 's apartment .
detec@@ tives car@@ ling and sk@@ el@@ ton are not here .
please ra@@ ise car 1 @-@ 3 @-@ 5 and ad@@ vise with their location , k .
so is this how you do things in hyde ?
you sit on your ass and watch known criminals pick their no@@ ses .
actually , in hyde , we sit on our no@@ ses and watch known criminals pick their asses .
all units , we have a report of a 10 @-@ 22 disturbance at aaa check cashing .
let 's go .
still think it 's trent ?
actually ... yeah .
hey , police !
take cover !
enough .
i hit him . - good .
you okay ?
uh , yeah , i think so .
b. p . ' s stab@@ i@@ li@@ zing , 9@@ 0 over 6@@ 0 .
pu@@ l@@ se is normal .
all right. the bleeding 's stopped .
excuse me . - all right , let 's get her .
ready ?
she 's gonna be okay .
all right . - all right , go ahead .
were where you guys ?
loot , we got a radio message to call into command .
now i figured it was you shu@@ tting down tyler 's brilliant surveillance sche@@ me .
took us three blocks south to find a pay phone .
found this radio in june 's car .
she must 've heard the call go out and tried to be b@@ at@@ girl or something .
and junie always had drea@@ ms of doing something important at the department .
i told her , " you 're a twi@@ r@@ l. know your place . " so she didn 't .
all right , i 'm gonna can@@ va@@ ss the blo@@ ck , get some st@@ ate@@ ments .
somebody must 've had e@@ ye@@ ba@@ lls on this .
this doesn 't make any sense .
trent took a huge ri@@ sk@@ . he knew we 'd be on to him .
there has to be a reason .
i want this mess cleaned up .
and i want you to clear this away .
i don 't want any of her left lying on the street .
this is an ac@@ tive crime scene .
it still n@@ ds to be proce@@ ssed .
clean it up !
i want you to clean it up now !
she works at the precinct .
she is family .
and i want to be able to look her dad in the eye and say you cleaned up every drop of her preci@@ ous blood .
get off me !
you can 't blame me , you l@@ un@@ a@@ tic !
this is trent 's fault !
he pulled the trigger !
you made sure there was a trigger to pull !
we had no evidence !
tell that to june !
i give up. i give up !
i 'm sick of this co@@ smi@@ c jo@@ ke that everyone seems to be in on but me !
i 'm sick of it .
real .
unreal .
real .
unreal .
you know , this neighborhood has gone to the do@@ gs .
mm @-@ hmm , right .
that 's , uh , an unusual a@@ sh@@ tray .
yeah. my grand@@ daughter so@@ fi@@ a made it for me .
she loves to come over and see all the butt@@ s in there .
she says , " n@@ onna uses it .
beautiful story .
should write a letter to the sur@@ ge@@ on general .
you know , if i squ@@ int , there 's a little bit of that ... ste@@ ve mc@@ que@@ en ?
look , you have an u@@ no@@ b@@ stru@@ cted view of aaa money from here , and jud@@ ging from how much you love your grand@@ child and ...
y@@ r ci@@ gar@@ e@@ tt@@ es , i 'm guessing you spend a lot of time looking out that window .
sure , i saw what happened , but aside from the shooting , there was nothing different from any tu@@ e@@ s@@ day or th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
you guys showed up , esc@@ or@@ ting the man who got shot .
us guys " ?
yeah , the police .
poli@@ ce@@ men ? in uniform ?
poli@@ ce@@ men in uniform .
you scre@@ wed up , you guys. real big @-@ t@@ i , huh , st@@ evi@@ e ?
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in or@@ bit to re@@ pa@@ ir a@@ iling sky@@ lab .
and those hi@@ pp@@ ies think they know how to get high , junie .
let 's see what kind of trouble da@@ g@@ wood 's ge@@ tt@@ in ' into today .
been looking for you , boss .
how 's she doing ?
same .
that felt good .
yeah ? then you 're gonna love this .
i always liked june .
truth be told , she 'd probably make a good cop .
i only know one way to police .
so do i .
i 'm not squ@@ ea@@ ky @-@ clean , and neither is this city .
i love this city .
it needs whoever it can get to look after it .
that 's me .
you 're gonna make this right .
well ...
i found a witness who saw two uni@@ forms esc@@ ort trent into the store .
that 's how they ga@@ ined access .
watch what you 're saying , tyler .
how can you ... the kee@@ per of ala@@ dd@@ in 's ca@@ ve ...
question the ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence of dirty cops just because , you know , you don 't like it ?
i 'm not turing the spo@@ t@@ light on my own department .
no , you 're just gonna co@@ erce te@@ sti@@ mon@@ y and set up suspects just to close the case .
oh , you got somethin ' on your mouth there. let me@@ --@@ let me see .
what are you do@@ in ' ?
hey , stop that ! - get off me !
don 't do@@ --@@ don 't do that . - i 'll do that .
police .
sp@@ ac@@ e@@ man !
heard the boss gave you a ri@@ de to pu@@ m@@ me@@ l city .
i need to talk with you , ray , about your moonlighting .
talk to me .
ain 't like i 'm the only one moonlighting at the 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 .
your named turned up on a list of cops who work security for aaa money .
yeah .
i make $ 3@@ 00 and change a week as a third grade detective .
that 's barely enough to af@@ ford the cla@@ ms arre@@ gan@@ at@@ a every friday night at gui@@ do 's .
so i work a little security when my money cli@@ p run@@ s a little light .
what 's the ca@@ la@@ m@@ ity ?
well , trent was working with cops .
cops were moonlighting as security .
you have fir@@ s@@ th@@ and k@@ n@@ led@@ ge .
you took a po@@ w@@ der on the sta@@ ke@@ out , right ?
so i 'm coming to you .
you coming to me ' cause you think i might be compli@@ c@@ it ?
it 's the first i 'm hearing about cops being involved .
well , hunt isn 't with me on this , but , uh , i got an e@@ ye@@ witness that says so .
you should talk to crocker .
the a. d.@@ a ?
if hunt 's st@@ on@@ e@@ walling , you 're gonna need a friend on the outside .
why are you doing this for me , going around hunt ?
hunt was my hook to second grade .
for three years , i car@@ ried his water .
lot of good that did me when you showed up .
crocker 's a little too bu@@ cking @-@ for @-@ sa@@ in@@ th@@ ood for my li@@ king , but he 's a straight shoo@@ ter .
he 'll know what to do. give him a try .
and you think cops from the 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 are involved ?
well , i don 't know .
hunt 's made it hard to get any trac@@ tion , so that 's why i 'm talking to you .
i 'll have one of my investig@@ ators look into it .
should take some of the pressure off .
i appreciate the help , not to mention your di@@ scre@@ tion .
of course .
he@@ ck of a way to int@@ ro@@ du@@ ce yourself to a new house .
you don 't know the half of it .
maya ? maya ? you in here ?
bo@@ o !
i 'll remember that next time you want me to work a uniform de@@ tail for you .
who says " bo@@ o " in this day and age ?
you 're like a car@@ to@@ on charac@@ ter from the funny papers .
who says " funny papers " in this day and age ?
like in the funny papers .
let 's light some can@@ d@@ les , run a bath .
i miss you , maya .
no inter@@ net , no d@@ v@@ d , no va@@ me@@ o ges ...
oh , but i don 't want to live in a world without video games .
you 're kin@@ d@@ a killing the m@@ ood .
hey , 2b !
i whi@@ pped up a tray of " welcome to the second floor " lasagna for you .
well , that 's , uh , very nice of you .
what 's nice is i 'm about to int@@ ro@@ du@@ ce you to the most lu@@ x@@ u@@ ri@@ ous lasagna you 've ever ta@@ sted .
not to t@@ oot my own hor@@ n@@ -- it 's my mom 's reci@@ pe@@ -- but it 's gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to cu@@ re what a@@ ils you .
that jer@@ k you brought home last night stole your watch ?
just have a sli@@ ce of mom 's lasagna .
the war in vie@@ t@@ na@@ m got you down ?
just tast@@ e that sm@@ oo@@ th ri@@ co@@ tt@@ a ch@@ ee@@ se .
how you doing today ?
like some mom 's lasagna will hit the spot .
ho@@ or@@ ay. it 's a gar@@ den mi@@ x .
there 's fre@@ sh to@@ ma@@ to@@ es , z@@ u@@ c@@ ch@@ in@@ i , car@@ ro@@ ts , pea@@ s , pl@@ enty of her@@ bs , and i ad@@ d a healthy sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ling of mary jane 's magic earth .
mary jane 's magic earth ?
no reci@@ pe is complete without it .
there 's mar@@ i@@ ju@@ an@@ a in here ?
it 's me@@ ll@@ ow , nothing like the blue de hu@@ e i had at my friend ran@@ dy 's pi@@ g roa@@ st .
you know i 'm a cop .
then you must get the really good stuff .
um , there 's something i 've been meaning to ask .
what you said the other day about sending messa@@ ges back to loved ones through the clouds ...
yeah ?
well ... do the clouds ever respon@@ d ?
no@@ pe. it 's just a one @-@ way thing .
i never hear from the clouds .
but the star@@ s-- they won 't shut up .
my mom , my dad , my brother gre@@ g@@ ory , my best friend lo@@ lly
they all send their love to me through the stars .
because the stars speak for the lonely , blue hearts , and lonely , blue hearts tell the truth .
i gotta run. enjoy the la@@ s ' .
and don 't forget , we still gotta dance .
as they say in new or@@ le@@ ans ...
ba@@ you .
there he is , fell@@ as .
there he is .
we should st@@ ring him up from the ra@@ f@@ ters by his sn@@ ea@@ ky little rat@@ tail .
what 's going on ? - what 's going on ?
look at him play possu@@ m now .
rats , possu@@ ms ...
what did i tell you about ana@@ lo@@ gies , ray ?
the loot just got off the phone with crocker .
nice work , tyler .
yeah , way to go , buddy .
un@@ believ@@ able , huh ?
did you really think it wouldn 't get back to me ?
good luck . - yeah , tell me about it .
listen , bo@@ b , did you get my e @-@ ma@@ il ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's right here .
real .
unreal .
real .
unreal .
sam , june 's a@@ wa@@ k@@ e. are you okay ?
they 're not real .
what are you talking about ?
the reason why i can 't track down the cops working with trent isn 't because hunt 's been st@@ on@@ e@@ walling .
it 's because they don 't exist .
sam , you 're not making any sense .
the cops from the check cashing robber@@ i@@ e@@ s-- they 're im@@ person@@ ators .
im@@ person@@ ators ?
they 're not real cops .
so the sa@@ w@@ bones a@@ ys you 're gonna be right as rain in no time .
okay ? - yeah .
i 'm still not clear what happened .
what happened was i took care of the guy that did this to you , shot him dead .
who ?
did you know kim trent ? - no .
but you cleaned his cell of vom@@ it. remember ?
what were you doing outside aaa money , june ?
what 's wrong with you ?
june seems emo@@ tional .
of course she 's emo@@ tion@@ al@@ . she was shot .
that 's not the kind of emo@@ tional i 'm talking about .
look at her .
kim 's dead ?
yeah , he died on the scene from a gu@@ n@@ shot wound to the chest .
that 's why you were there with the police radio .
you weren 't respon@@ ding to the call , ' cause you were already there as a look@@ out and the ge@@ ta@@ way driver .
no. i just got the radio .
for kim .
yes. i mean no. kim loves me .
it took a while , but we found each other .
we ha@@ dn 't seen each other since high school in yo@@ n@@ kers , and then there he was , outside of the precinct , and he looked me up .
that 's the kind of guy he was .
and you f@@ ed him information .
kim 's gone , june .
it 's time to start worrying about yourself .
i told kim thing@@ s-- who was working where and when .
eventually i was able to pin@@ ch some uni@@ forms and some du@@ pe shi@@ el@@ ds .
no one noti@@ ce@@ d. no one ever d. ti@@ ce nobody noticed me except kim .
and the radio message that called off chris and ra@@ y-- that was you ?
yes .
i thought you always wanted to join me on the burea@@ u .
and be like you-- taking the same crap , day after day ?
you 're foo@@ ling yourself if you ever think they 'll acce@@ pt you as one of them .
junie , you know who was foo@@ ling the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves ?
this , um ...
listen to me .
i know wha@@ it feels like to be alone .
it 's like someone 's stolen away the one thing in the world you cared most about .
well , it happened to me , too .
the uni@@ verse knocked me side@@ ways and took away everything and everyone i ever cared about .
you and me ...
we have the same lonely , blue heart , june .
yeah. i guess i do have a lonely , blue heart .
yeah .
kim told me things .
he was working with two guys , da@@ x ben@@ son and fre@@ ddy ger@@ ard .
okay. do you know where we can find them ?
i promised kim i wouldn 't say anything .
june , june , i 'm sorry , but it wasn 't real .
what you think you had with trent was not real .
you 're protec@@ ting the same man who put you in this hospital bed .
he 's killed four innocent peop@@ le. do you understand ?
it 's time to tell us everything .
cause lonely , blue hearts tell the truth .
get down ! police ! - don 't move !
you are sur@@ r@@ ounded by armed ba@@ star@@ ds .
da@@ x ben@@ son ! hold it right there .
put your feet on the gr@@ oun@@ d. put your hands on your head .
you are under arrest .
just in time , boys . - drop it .
no , no , no , no !
i 'm on the j ! i 'm a cop ! he 's not !
i 'm real ! he 's not ! get off me !
real cops don 't run away .
lieutenant gene hunt , 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 . - what ?
kin@@ dly get off of my man .
- come on. let 's go .
come on. move .
this is why trent 's cre@@ w hit so many check cashing stores so quick .
they needed cash ' cause there was a shi@@ p@@ ment on the way .
all right , you two , let 's go .
you ain 't got no ri@@ ght@@ s. get in there .
heroin ... - yahtzee !
and lots of it .
all right , step up .
you did good , tyler .
but next time you start having words with an a. d.@@ a .
you make damn sure i know ahead of time .
see you tomorrow , boss .
we 'll be out of here in five .
once again , you walk io the space i was headed for .
you and i are not gonna get along , are we ? - nope .
eventually , i will burn you down , and i will bag your ashes , and i will bury your ashes in the yard where my big dog cra@@ ps big crap .
anyway , wow .
i asked you for help .
you made me out to be a rat .
it wasn 't like that .
gene has a way of doing things .
i have a way of dealing with him .
it 's nothing personal .
sam , he 's right .
it 's compli@@ ca@@ ted dealing with hunt .
you of all people should know that .
what 's that ?
oh , um , well , lee got us tick@@ ets to see " grea@@ se .
you know , it 's been playing for a year , and i 've been dying to see it , so ...
summer lo@@ v@@ in ' . had me a blast .
i got a dinner to get to .
i 'll see you later , an@@ nie .
you okay , sam ?
yeah. fine .
you 're a good cop , sam .
there 's less heroin on the street ' cause you 're in the 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 .
and that is very real .
good night , an@@ nie .
good night , sam .
i miss you , too , baby .
i miss you , too , from the bottom of my lonely , blue heart .
time to dance , 2b .
... four brothers ...
... gene@@ tically re@@ born in the se@@ wers of new york .
named after the great ren@@ a@@ i@@ ss@@ ance masters ...
... and trained as ninjas .
they ba@@ tt@@ led many creatures and fo@@ es before def@@ eating their arch@@ en@@ emy ...
... the shredder .
but now a grea@@ ter evil is poi@@ sed to destroy their very brotherhood .
an evil born 3000 years ago .
it was in that time that a warrior king named yoatl ...
... led a brotherhood that f@@ ought side by side with one pur@@ pose :
to con@@ qu@@ er all the king@@ doms of the world .
nothing could stand in their way ...
... as they left a tra@@ il of destruction behind them .
in his quest , the warrior lear@@ ned of a con@@ stell@@ ation ...
... known as the stars of kikan .
every 3000 years , the stars would align ...
... opening a portal to a world of unknown power .
he became immortal ...
... but at a price .
his brotherhood was turned to stone .
and upon the portal 's opening ...
... 13 monsters were released into our world .
the warrior king was left to eter@@ na@@ lly walk the earth ...
... un@@ able to die or forget his horri@@ ble mistake .
and the monsters that were un@@ lea@@ shed ...
... continue to plague man@@ kind to this very day .
monsters .
no .
we appreciate the generous donation ...
... for the continued protection of your village .
after all , the jungle can be a very dangerous place .
ma@@ ma ! - oh , she is dangerous .
there 's monsters out there .
watch where you 're going .
there 's a log on the road , se ? or .
well , if you 're not too busy , re@@ move it .
who are you ? show yourself .
the ghost of the jung@@ le. he puni@@ shes those who prey upon the weak .
he 's coming .
i just remembered i left the sto@@ ve on. my wife ha@@ tes that .
co@@ ward. get back here . - you 're on your own , je@@ fe .
show yourself. do you realize who you 're dealing with ?
what is this ... ? what ?
i am not afraid of a myth .
i 'm not afraid of a ghost .
what are you ?
it 's a mi@@ rac@@ le .
the ghost of the jungle .
there. that 's where i saw him .
thank you .
you 'd better get home now .
do you know the ghost ?
he wasn 't always a ghost .
hello ?
is anyone here ?
hello ?
it 's a long way from the city to just drop in .
you came all the way down here to look for me ?
actually , i was already here on business .
but then the lo@@ cal legend started soun@@ ding familiar ...
... so i decided to sno@@ op around .
what kind of business ? - anci@@ ent arti@@ facts .
some ty@@ co@@ on with too much time on his hands ...
... has his heart set on a colle@@ ction of 3000 @-@ year @-@ old statues .
well , you always did run with a strange crowd , april .
yeah , well. our strange crowd hasn 't been the same without you .
things aren 't looking so good back home .
how bad could it be ?
donnie 's probably got everything under control .
sir ? sir. sir .
did you turn the compu@@ ter on ? have you p@@ lu@@ gged it in ?
yeah , that would help .
no , i 'm not playing hard to get .
i 'm telling you , sir , it 's not that kind of phone line .
i 'm not your en@@ e@@ my. i 'm just donnie , your friendly it tech support ...
... here to help you 24 hours a day , sir .
yeah , i 'm sorry. ma 'am .
but donnie 's a gen@@ i@@ us. why would he take a job like that ?
at least he 's keeping busy .
well , if he 's doing that , who 's keeping an eye on mikey ?
mi@@ ke 's gotten into the enter@@ tain@@ ment business .
yeah .
happy birthday from cowabunga carl .
take it easy , little dudes. i bruise easily .
hey , black @-@ and @-@ blue cla@@ shes with green , dudes. hey , that 's ...
he 's a big hit .
all right. let 's hear it. what 's raph doing ?
no one really kno@@ ws. he just slee@@ ps all day .
well , what 's he do all night ?
2802 , 2802 , burglary in pro@@ gre@@ ss at 5@@ 5th and bro@@ ad@@ way .
suspects consi@@ dered armed and dangerous .
time to p@@ unch in .
good work , boy@@ s. that was easier than i thought it was gonna be .
hey , look , guys. i grab@@ bed a to@@ a@@ ster .
i love your work eth@@ ic , tom@@ my. it 's an inspiration to us all .
what was that ?
what 's going on , guys ?
what in the ... ?
looks like it 's just you and me , sha@@ ky .
take it ea@@ s@@ y. i 'm not gonna hurt you ...
... much .
i love when they play hard to get .
the nightwatcher .
he 's doing our job for us again . - tommy .
keep your hands to yourself . - hey , who 's tick@@ ling me ?
your training period ended a year ago .
and splinter says you don 't write anymore .
splinter sent me down here to become a better leader .
i can 't go back a failure .
besides , these people need me more than my brothers do .
if master splinter were here ...
... he would ask you , " what is your heart telling you ?
i don 't know. i just know something 's missing .
your brothers need you , leo .
they 're lost without you .
why skate a hal@@ f@@ pipe when you can skate a sewer pipe ?
sewer 's up , bra .
hey .
cowabunga .
dude. going down .
yeah .
here 's mikey .
guys ?
anyone ?
hello ?
whatever .
this place used to be fun .
and with rocke@@ ting interest rates , that 's bad news for homeowners ...
... as the real @-@ estate market continu@@ es its down@@ ward spira@@ l .
coming up , the vigilante known as nightwatcher stri@@ kes again .
now , i can 't say for sure , but he was definitely an alien .
i think it 's a dis@@ gr@@ ace , taking the law into your own hands like that .
leave it to the police . - up next ...
i remember how that used to feel , bu@@ sting up crime syn@@ di@@ cates .
sure , they had a bunch of guns , but they weren 't like these guns .
why do you do this to yourself , mikey ? those gl@@ ory days are over .
forget about them. get on with your li@@ fe. con@@ centra@@ te on your work .
yeah , yeah. spo@@ ken like a true has @-@ been .
well , look who woke up .
i suppose you think the nightwatcher is some kind of hero .
beats sitting around doing nothing while dir@@ t@@ ba@@ gs run free .
i would love to know what it is that you do that 's so great .
we 're con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting around here. all you do is sleep .
yeah , i do nothing. you 're right. you got me all figured out .
i know that your attitude has been a sour@@ ce of con@@ ten@@ tion to this team .
you think fear is the best way to accompli@@ sh things .
first of all , this team you speak of doesn 't exist anymore .
and second of all ...
enough .
i think i made my point .
that doesn 't prove anything .
why couldn 't you send him away for training ?
don@@ ate@@ llo , this home has become like an empty shell .
each of your brothers has streng@@ ths and weaknesses .
you must learn to be strong when they are weak .
if you don 't learn to recognize this ...
... then all hope is lost for our family .
keep it coming .
hey , careful .
those aren 't sou@@ venirs .
sorry about that , ma 'am .
where are you , casey ?
come on. come on , pick up .
don 't do this to me again. not now .
casey can 't come to the phone right now because we 're hardly working .
this better be good .
casey , i am standing on the do@@ ck with a pri@@ ce@@ less statu@@ e and no delivery truck .
so my question is , where are you ? - april .
hey , babe. i am so sorry. i set the al@@ arm clock , but ...
it 's brok@@ en. the clock ...
it 's bad enough that you 're out every night playing vigilante ...
... but we 've got a dea@@ d@@ line to meet . - i 'm sorry .
oh , wait , babe , real quic@@ k. you left a message saying you found leo .
i mean , is he there with you ? - no .
i found him. he 's not coming back .
but didn 't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the turtles ?
look , casey , we 're gonna lose the biggest client we have ...
... if you don 't get down here .
all right. i 'm on my way .
please tell me we 're getting paid by the p@@ ound here .
is this place a mus@@ e@@ um or what ?
you 've never heard of winterscorp ? - that 's what i 'm telling you .
they 're into everything : real estate , tech@@ no@@ logy , p@@ har@@ ma@@ ce@@ uti@@ cals , hair gel .
i don 't wear hair gel . - really ?
i 'm the ca@@ veman type , a@@ u natu@@ rel .
just make sure you don 't touch anything in here .
hey , i was born careful .
hope that wasn 't expen@@ sive .
oh , wait ... just ... i 'm ...
oh , boy . - please tell me that wasn 't you .
mr. winters . - miss o 'neil .
all the pieces are coming together .
oh , my. this is my associ@@ ate , casey .
nice to meet you , ken@@ ny . - boy@@ friend. it 's casey .
so you were su@@ c@@ ce@@ ss@@ ful ? - yes. the fourth general .
i want to ask you before i go ...
... if i could take one last look ?
i believe this is the one they call general a@@ ke@@ ela ?
it 's actually " aguila , " but that was a good try .
these statues may appear to be only stone ...
... but they 're like family to me. i didn 't choose them .
friends you can choose , but never your family .
okay , then .
take care , mr. winters .
if you 've come to kill me , could you make it fast ?
i 've got a shar@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ' meeting at 1@@ 0. i 'd rather miss it .
if we had come here to hurt you , you 'd be hur@@ ting already .
the foot clan and i have come to hear your offer .
well , it appears that today is my lucky day .
i must warn you , we do not come chea@@ p .
does it look like money is of any concern to me ?
only time is of the e@@ ss@@ ence , my dear .
since you 're so ri@@ ch and powerful ...
... what is it we could possibly have to offer you ?
i need you to be my eyes and ears .
i have some friends coming to town ...
... that i 'd like to roll out the red carpet for .
gre@@ et them warmly and bring them to me .
and how will we know these friends ?
don 't worry , they 're impossible to miss .
and you keep them up. got that ?
and don 't let me catch you calling the cops .
what ? not again .
didn 't i take care of you last week ?
hey. oh , no. come on , now. wait .
i 'm very disappointed in you , k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ head .
guess night school 's in session .
hope i 'm not distur@@ bing class .
hey , nightwatcher , need any teaching assi@@ stan@@ ts ?
oh , no. casey .
i got this one covered , pal. thanks , but no , thanks .
you think you own these roof@@ to@@ ps ? i happen to think you could use my help .
and i could use a sidekick .
you may have everyone else fooled , but you haven 't fooled me , raph .
yeah , well , guess what , pal. now you ...
hey , wait a minute. how did you know it was me ?
wasn 't that hard , man. you know , you look like a big , metal turtle .
it 's that obvi@@ ous , huh ?
i should 've sta@@ yed in law school . - ain 't that cute ? he 's trying to get away .
well , looks like i got a sidekick .
yeah , right. you 're the sidekick .
what , is it perform@@ ance ar@@ t ? i don 't get it . - what was i supposed to do ...
... sit around , wait for leo to come back and save the day ?
i mean , we haven 't heard word one from him ...
... since splinter sent him away on his little vacation .
you think these low@@ lif@@ es take vacations at the first sign of pressure ?
no. the criminal ele@@ ment of this city may be guilty of a lot of things ...
... but being qu@@ it@@ ters ain 't one of them .
you know , i don 't even care about leo anymore .
kind of hope he never comes back .
come on , aren 't you being a little hard on the guy ?
i don 't know. it 's possible .
i guess if i could live anywhere other than the city , i 'd go too .
but i could never leave this place .
i can 't even sleep without the sound of the sub@@ way ru@@ mbling over my head .
i guess it comes from gro@@ wing up with a house@@ ful of brothers .
i 'm not trying to tell you what to do .
i 'm just saying that if it was my brother , i 'd find a way to work it out .
but that 's just me .
i got my own issu@@ es , you know ? like back at home , with april .
there 's this whole thing about se@@ tt@@ ling down ...
... that makes me miss the old times .
i don 't know if i can be the gro@@ wnup she needs me to be .
good talk , raph .
arise , my brother@@ s. arise , dear sister .
the stars of kikan align .
all ye generals , wake from your stone slu@@ mber .
dude .
dude .
enter .
kneel , my son .
i return from my training , master .
i was so caught up in my own world , i forgot about everyone else .
i 'm sorry i failed .
on the contr@@ ary , my son ...
... now you are much stron@@ ger .
your streng@@ th is needed here now .
you owe me no apo@@ logy , but perhaps you should talk to raphael .
your ab@@ sen@@ ce has been par@@ ti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly difficult for him ...
... though he 'll never admit it .
i 'm certain things will be back to normal in no time , master .
good. because until you can act as one , you are forbidden to fight .
yes , sensei .
i have missed you , leonardo .
i 've missed you too , father .
your brother is home .
hey . - hey .
welcome home .
yeah. thanks .
well , i 'm going to bed .
hey , leo 's back. better go say hello before he leaves again .
what ? leo . - hey .
hey . - huh , leo ?
is that really you ? - yeah .
i 'm , like , dreaming , aren 't i ? - no , mikey , you 're not dreaming .
oh , good. i have night@@ mar@@ es about birthday par@@ ties .
okay , leo , i 'll bit@@ e. what are we doing up here ?
i told splinter i 'd get this team in shape again .
hey , i 've been training. since you left , my video @-@ game scor@@ es have , like , doubled .
right , and while you 've been playing games , brother ...
... nightwatcher 's come into the neighborhood ...
... like some kind of vigilante show@@ bo@@ at. but his days are done .
hey , you went a@@ wol , leo ...
... and the nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the s@@ lack .
crime never took a break. you did .
i heard his bike turns into a plane or , like , a jetp@@ ack .
hey , don , you 're so smart , why don 't we have jetpacks ?
that 's good , mi@@ ke@@ y. i don 't even trust you with a driver 's license .
have you seen the way this guy beha@@ ves ...
someone 's c@@ ran@@ ky .
okay , jungle bo@@ y. grab a v@@ ine . - raph , wait .
splinter told us not to fight .
jungle boy . " good one “ .
all right. but remember , we 're only up here for training .
you know what i always say , " train by doing , dude .
mikey , when have you ever said that ?
you smell that ? it 's like a monkey cage up here .
wow , good news is , there 's a bunch of foot ninjas ...
... getting the s@@ not kicked out of them .
bad news is , this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon .
yeah , so ? you think we should help these guys ?
i 'd rather enjoy the sho@@ w. what do you say , fearless leader ?
we 're not ... - i say we stop talking .
come here , fuzzy wuzzy .
you .
i think we 're getting off on the wrong foot here .
we 're trying to help you . - never .
team .
wait , the shredder 's dead .
who are you working for ?
hey , a little help , o fearless one .
that was too easy .
like i said , too easy .
bad dog .
look at me. found the elevator .
oh , my shoulder .
my sp@@ le@@ en .
this place needed a sky@@ light .
this is why we need jetpacks .
okay , any more b@@ right ideas ? - how about this ?
when this is over , i 'm totally calling the arch@@ ite@@ ct .
wait a minute. how did something that big just disa@@ pp@@ ear ? it doesn 't ...
dude , it 's the cops .
oh , yeah. the turtles are back , dudes .
i give us a 10 for style , an eight for s@@ kill ...
... and a two for stea@@ lth .
what seems to be the problem ?
the problem is that we were hired to mer@@ ely pat@@ rol the city ...
... and report anything strange to you .
you never said anything about monsters .
now , i 'm sorry that your ill@@ u@@ stri@@ ous group have been redu@@ ced to hired guns ...
... but i believe we made a deal , karai .
and i expect you to honor it .
you do understand honor , don 't you ?
so how did we f@@ are ?
my , my , my. and what is your name ?
were there any problems , general ?
none , my lord .
then show these foo@@ ls how a true warrior ac@@ ts .
keep them on schedule in comple@@ ting their ta@@ sk .
we do not need any help .
never@@ the@@ less , karai , i trust my family more than i trust you .
you may be the eyes and ears , but they are the mus@@ cle .
they will help you ga@@ ther the rema@@ in@@ ing 12 of these ab@@ om@@ in@@ ations ...
... so we can finally see our birth@@ rights fu@@ l@@ fi@@ lled .
it 's going to be quite a party .
dudes , did anyone get the license pla@@ te of that thing that hit us last night ?
my head .
okay , that was just weird. i mean , first the foot , then that hi@@ de@@ ous monster .
yeah. it looked like your mom , dude .
yeah , that would make her your mom too , d@@ oo@@ f@@ us .
yeah , whatever .
keep laugh@@ ing. last night was an embarrass@@ ment .
i 'll tell you what 's embarrass@@ ing. you can 't follow a single order .
oh , how cu@@ te. you 've been back for five minutes ...
... and now you 're schoo@@ ling us on your master plan ?
okay , so this is my fault now , huh , raph ?
i 'm the only one that has to be responsible ?
hey , you 're the trained master , not me .
dudes , can it. here comes splinter .
good morning , my sons .
good morning , sensei . - su@@ p ?
every ninja 's day should start with a healthy brea@@ k@@ fast .
it fi@@ lls me with pri@@ de to see you boys together again .
if anyone needs me , i 'll be watching my stories .
ho@@ thea@@ d . - splinter j@@ r .
co@@ dy is going to break up with don@@ na@@ . i just know it .
we interrupt the gi@@ l@@ more girls for this special news report .
monsters loose in the city ?
strange repor@@ ts are coming in about an incident ...
... that sounds like something out of science fic@@ tion .
boys !
leonardo , i am most disappointed in you .
you are the el@@ de@@ st of your brothers .
i was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family .
this is why i have forbidden any surface ac@@ tiv@@ ity .
we cannot return to the surface to fight evil ...
... if we continue to fight each other .
but master splinter , how can i be expected to do so ...
there are no exc@@ uses when you are the leader , my student .
we have to go out and find who 's responsible for this .
there ain 't no other solution .
save the bru@@ te @-@ vigilante junk for that nightwatch@@ man .
nightwatcher . - nightwatcher .
yeah , whatever .
i 'm going out .
witnesses say there are holes in the flo@@ ors ...
... as if something or someone had just bla@@ sted straight down through them ...
... leaving authori@@ ties scratching their heads .
well , at least some people care about justice these days .
hey , casey .
raph ? - meet me on the roof , okay ?
what is it ?
the roof. you know what the roof is , don 't you ?
pushy sidekick .
we 've gotten this i@@ mage in from an amateur camer@@ a@@ man ...
... and i do stress " amateur .
casey , come look at this .
be safe .
what 's this all about , raph ?
we got bigger things to worry about than criminals .
like what ?
come on .
i think we lost it .
it 's gotta be around here somewhere .
i don 't think so .
what 's going on , raph ?
did i mention we ran into a monster last night ?
no , you kind of failed to tell me about that one , buddy .
you do know i only have a wooden b@@ at , don 't you ?
the foot ? i thought they were history .
and now we got walking statues ? you got a plan for those ?
yeah. hey , those are a first for me too .
and who knows ? these guys might be friendly .
friendly .
wait a second. those statues look ...
witnesses .
watch out .
i don 't feel so good .
that can 't be good .
that 's just rude .
hey , wait up .
raph ? - come here .
what , you never heard of smoke pellets ? - warn me next time .
i got allergies .
come on. that 's the second mask this week .
they 'll never find us in here .
stay with me , now. we 'll be out of here soon .
no .
and i thought girl sc@@ ou@@ ts were pushy .
some people just can 't take a hint .
this is the police. you on the roof , put your hands behind your ...
what is that ? tommy , you see this ?
yeah , you better run .
i gotta hand it to you , raph ...
... you sure know how to show a lady a good time .
oh , no. i gotta get you someplace safe , pal .
my compli@@ ments to the che@@ f .
anyone for de@@ ss@@ er@@ t ?
no . - yes .
cowabunga carl party servic@@ e@@ s. cowabunga , dude .
raph 's hur@@ t. you need to get over here . - s@@ low down , april .
what happened to raph ? - i don 't know. he 's unconscious .
we 'll be right there .
leo. you came back .
sorry the re@@ uni@@ on isn 't under better circumstances .
nice pa@@ d , kids .
oh , hey , raph .
well , his v@@ ital signs seem to be okay .
pu@@ pi@@ l di@@ lation is normal .
some sort of st@@ one. probably ob@@ si@@ di@@ an , i think .
well , is he gonna be all right ?
you 're still here ? go back to your jungle .
well , at least his person@@ ality 's still int@@ act .
and there 's an en@@ gra@@ ving on it. looks south american .
that 's your department , april .
would it help if i told you that those statues you collected for winters ...
... were shooting these things at me and raph ?
the legend of yoatl . " it can 't be .
it was just a myth ...
... a scary story the lo@@ cals told kids around a ca@@ mp@@ fire .
whoa , what are you talking about ?
they say 3000 years ago , some great warrior ...
... actually found a portal to another di@@ men@@ sion .
and when the portal opened ...
... the energy from it gave the warrior eter@@ nal life .
but it also turned his generals to stone .
what if this warrior just kept living forever ?
he would spend the rest of his days in re@@ gre@@ t ...
... spending all of his ri@@ ches and all of his power ...
... to find a way to re@@ vive his stone generals .
maybe , just maybe ...
... he 's buil@@ t a new emp@@ i@@ re .
but , hey , like i said , it 's just a myth .
if you ask me , guys , this has winters ' name written all over it .
how do you figure that , donnie ? - yeah .
because this has winters ' name written all over it .
now i know who to thank for this shot in the arm .
so where do we find this guy and his stone jo@@ kers ?
we 're not going until we get splinter 's ble@@ ssing .
you 're gonna quo@@ te a ru@@ le@@ book to me that you ain 't been following for a year ?
if you got something you wanna get off your shell , now 's the time .
but i 'm not gonna stand here and debate splinter 's orders with you .
fine , th@@ en. i quit .
hey , rap@@ h. don 't do it , man .
sometimes just taking a brea@@ ther is the best thing to do .
whatever .
to picking up the pieces .
what is it ?
two creatures remain , my lord .
well , by all means , then , let 's finish it .
and you will finally be free of your stone prison .
but if the curse is broken , we will no longer be immortal .
brother , do not question my command .
here we go , now . - so , what are we looking for ?
well , according to these star char@@ ts , the portal is set to open ...
... directly over winters tower in the next 24 hours .
so the legend is right. three thous@@ and years .
and when the portal open@@ s , we 'll lose the city to monsters within hours .
within days , the coun@@ tr@@ y. and within weeks , the world .
oh , so it 's like hall@@ ey 's com@@ et , only monsters come out ?
yes. i guess so .
i 'm smart .
i 'm okay .
why do we need raph , anyway ?
it 's his temper that always je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ zes all our mi@@ ssions .
okay , leo. whatever you say. nobody was talking about him .
leonardo , this team you are so eager to lead is in@@ complete .
you know what you must do .
yes , sensei .
generals , i think our brother has plans to betray us .
the 13th monster must not be found .
why don 't we take one more call about these monster sightings ?
suff@@ ern , new jersey , you 're on .
monster sightings .
a monster !
attention , all on @-@ duty offic@@ ers :
report of a disturbance on 3@@ 2@@ n@@ d. no units a@@ vailable .
they 're playing my song .
where are the cops ? how come the cops haven 't shown up ?
just remember what my analy@@ st said , just go to my happy place .
everything 's gonna be fine. happy place. i 'm feeling good. i 'm thin .
don 't get up. i 'll ser@@ ve myself .
look at you. ain 't you cute ?
you want a bu@@ tt @-@ kicking , little fella ? yes , you do. you do .
come on , i 'm gonna drop @-@ kick you to hur@@ ty town@@ . come on , little guy .
get off of me , you little monster .
you 're scratching the hel@@ met .
okay , that was different .
hey , this thing ain 't ru@@ st@@ p@@ roof. get off of me .
come on .
how about a sn@@ ack , little fella ?
catch .
keep on running , you filthy little her@@ mit cra@@ b .
that sp@@ ic@@ y mea@@ t@@ ball 's on the house .
big guy , please don 't hurt me .
what ? i 'm not robbing you , i 'm helping you .
okay , whatever you say , sir. please , i got kids in college .
community college .
here you go , pal. make sure this is safe .
take every@@ thing. i 'm not even look@@ ing. go .
why is it everyone 's got such a hard time believ@@ ing i am a good guy ?
i just sa@@ ved your life .
this night just keeps getting better and better .
get off my car .
i want you to know that i appreciate your inten@@ tions ...
... but you can 't change the world like this .
the road you 're on is a dead end . - is he kidding ?
i 've tried it . - he 's le@@ c@@ turing .
so i 'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away ...
... and stop this vigilante nonsense .
okay , leo ...
... time to tea@@ ch you a lesson .
look , trust me when i tell you , you don 't wanna do this .
oh , yeah. well , i notice you got quite a temper .
hey , have you ever done this before ?
oh , come on. you call that an attack ?
all right. finally , some excitement .
funny thing about anger :
let it con@@ sume you , and soon enough ...
... you lose sight of everything .
good night , dark pr@@ ince .
what ?
you are so s@@ mu@@ g , you know that ?
you think the world rev@@ ol@@ ves around you , don 't you ?
we couldn 't survi@@ ve without the mi@@ gh@@ ty and powerful leonardo ...
... to gui@@ de us through our problems .
well , i got a news fla@@ sh for you : we got along just fine without you .
oh , and this quali@@ fi@@ es as " just fine " ? dressing up like it 's hall@@ o@@ ween every night ?
ris@@ king the safety of our family ? i mean , come on , what were you thinking ?
don 't push it. you can 't leave and come back ...
... expecting us to fall in line like your little sol@@ di@@ ers .
hey , i was training. training to be a better leader , for you .
why do you hate me for that ? - and whoever said i wanted to be led ?
i 'm better off calling my own shots now. get used to it .
you aren 't rea@@ dy. you 're im@@ patient and hot @-@ tempered .
and more impor@@ tan@@ tly , i 'm better than you .
oh , you know something , big brother ?
i 'd have to disa@@ gree with you on that one .
don 't do this , raph .
i 'm done taking orders .
not human ...
... but clearly not the final monster .
yoatl won 't know the differ@@ ence .
by the time our brother disco@@ vers this turtle is not the 13th monster ...
... it will already be too late .
leo. hang on .
no !
raphael. what is the matter ?
i was out. i was out and i did ... i did something .
something happened and then l ... and i ...
raphael. kneel .
i did something .
i did something really stupid , master splinter .
go on .
i know why you cho@@ se him now .
i know that there 's a reason why he 's the better son and i 'm not .
raphael , you always bear the world 's problems on your shoulders .
it is an admi@@ r@@ able quality when you are a protec@@ tor of others .
but you must realize that while , at times , you may not be my favorite student ...
... it does not mean that you are my least @-@ favorite son .
you are strong , passionate and loyal to a fault .
these are the mer@@ its of a great leader as well ...
... but only when tempered with com@@ passion and hu@@ mi@@ lity .
but , master splinter , i messed up big tonight .
i mean big .
they took him .
yeah .
then the time for hiding is over .
we must return to the surface to take back what is ours .
by your wish , father .
long have we been in hid@@ ing. perhaps too long .
well , what do we do now ?
i 'll tell you what we 're gonna do .
we 're gonna re@@ sc@@ ue our brother , and then we 're gonna save new york city .
i got it on my last trip to j@@ ap@@ an. you like it ?
oh , yeah .
no way .
you can 't go tri@@ ck @-@ or @-@ treating without your mask .
oh , babe. thanks .
as ordered , no one gets into the tower ...
... no one interferes , no one bears witness .
you 've got to be kidding me .
cowabunga , dude. i 'm here for little max@@ ie 's 13th birthday party .
leave now .
oh , but you don 't understand , lady. i got ...
at la@@ st. after 3000 years , the time is finally at hand .
what ... ? what have you done ?
your time for giving orders is over .
you don 't understand .
i want to send these creatures back ...
... to un@@ do the damage that was done so many years ago .
time has done nothing but made you weak .
we have our own plans .
immorta@@ lity is a curse , brother .
trust me , i 've lived long enough to know .
we have to find that 13th mon@@ st@@ er. it 's time to end it .
no .
our time is just beginning .
little help , don . - i 'm on it .
heads up , dudes .
go@@ al .
guys , front door 's open@@ . now .
two minutes for high stic@@ king .
dudes , that rocke@@ d. let 's go again .
dudes , what do we do ? - i 'm working on it .
you break it , you buy it .
yeah. all right .
all right. nice .
nice work , jones . - i have my moments .
whoa , check it out .
that would be the swi@@ r@@ ling vortex to another world , i assume .
cool. i want one .
leo , is that you ?
sorry , wrong cage .
leo. i got him . - out of the way , please .
hey , bu@@ ddy. come on , man. up we go .
there you go .
you 're gonna need these if you 're gonna lead us out of here .
i 'm gonna need you too .
winters . - looks more like fa@@ ll. get it ?
mikey , remember our talk .
looks like someone got to him before us .
is he dead ?
not so immortal , huh , dudes ?
your time 's run out , winters .
miss o 'neil .
i must have hit my head pretty har@@ d. i 'm seeing gi@@ ant turtles .
we know what you 're up to , winters. we know about the portal ...
... and we think that it 's time you sent all these monsters home .
i couldn 't agree with you more .
it is time to put an end to the curse that i have brought upon myself ...
... and this world .
that 's what this is about , miss o 'neil : pen@@ ance .
i must return all 13 bea@@ sts or our curse will continue .
and that is a tor@@ ment i can no longer bear .
then you should be put out of your misery .
i think we walked in on a family fe@@ ud , guys .
the time has come to re@@ open the portal and rain destruction upon the earth .
nothing will stand in our way ...
... when we have an army at our command .
my brothers , l ... - we are no brothers to you .
with one monster still free , the curse will never be broken .
we sha@@ ll finish what we began all those years ago .
and we will finally have our victory .
join us. join us , foot clan .
swear your alle@@ gi@@ ance to us and no har@@ m will be@@ fall you .
the foot ninja is not without hon@@ or. we work for winters , not you .
okay , what does that mean ?
it means we 're going to help you .
my ninja will find the last monster and you will bring it back here .
hurry , we don 't have much time .
hey. i got shotgun .
forget about them .
by the time they return , the portal will already be closed ...
... with you inside it .
i hate to see brothers fight like this .
unless it 's together .
hate to rain on your parade , pal , but we thought we 'd even the odds .
we 're going to enjoy this .
if you please. they can de@@ fe@@ at them .
they are a team .
let 's hope so , because if not , aguila will use the portal ...
... to draw for@@ th an army of evil and the world will be lost .
more bea@@ st@@ s. let 's send them back where they belong .
temper , temper .
come to da@@ ddy .
thing about you immortal stone guys is ...
... you know , you 're immortal and made of stone .
i sound like mikey .
you fight well. you should join us .
no , thanks , i 'm good .
these guys really don 't di@@ e. sensei , are you all right ?
we must do this more often .
i still got it .
they 'd better hurry with that last monster .
i 'm sure my man casey 's got it all under control .
that 's what i 'm afraid of .
can 't this piece of junk go fa@@ ster ?
wanna drive ? - i would , as a matter of fact .
you would think they would be more concer@@ ned about the 13th monster .
boys , we must finish this now .
so did we win ?
foo@@ lish crea@@ tu@@ res. we are immor@@ tals made of stone .
without the final monster to break our curse ...
... we will never be stopped .
special delivery .
look out .
so did we win now ?
yeah , i think we did . - we won .
all right . - yeah !
all right. that 's what i 'm talking about .
yeah !
nice par@@ all@@ el parking .
next time , i 'm driving .
hey. watch the hair .
ty@@ pi@@ ca@@ l. we do all the work , he gets all the thanks .
you are every bit the warriors i was infor@@ med you were .
you have passed .
sa@@ vor your victory tonight .
for soon , we will have further business together .
the kind that invol@@ ves familiar faces from your past .
she doesn 't mean ...
come on. what is it with ninjas and smoke pellets ?
looks like you picked a good time to come home .
thanks for bringing me back .
i 'm never usually that happy to be in pain .
he 's happy because he 's mor@@ tal again , mikey .
apri@@ l. i 've had my eye on you for a long time .
i knew it .
i 've always known that you 'd be the one to help me find my way home .
and thank you ...
... brothers .
you 've made a very old man very , very happy .
so , what happens now ?
okay. just a little bit cre@@ e@@ py .
oh , gross. i think he 's in my no ... my no ... my no ...
gross. somebody give me a han@@ kie .
now he 's in my mouth .
tast@@ es awful .
you got room for one more ?
can i get rid of this too ?
we live together. we train together .
we fight together. we stand for good , together .
we are ninjas .
we stri@@ ke hard , defend , protect , and fa@@ de into the night .
and there ain 't no bad guy or monster gonna ever change that .
that 's what 's important .
and that 's why we 'll always be brothers .
oh , i love being a turtle .
four turtles ...
... four brothers ...
... gene@@ tically re@@ born in the se@@ wers of new york .
named after the great ren@@ a@@ i@@ ss@@ ance masters ...
... and trained as ninjas .
they ba@@ tt@@ led many creatures and fo@@ es before def@@ eating their arch@@ en@@ emy ...
... the shredder .
but now a grea@@ ter evil is poi@@ sed to destroy their very brotherhood .
an evil born 3000 years ago .
it was in that time that a warrior king named yoatl ...
... led a brotherhood that f@@ ought side by side with one pur@@ pose :
to con@@ qu@@ er all the king@@ doms of the world .
nothing could stand in their way ...
... as they left a tra@@ il of destruction behind them .
in his quest , the warrior lear@@ ned of a con@@ stell@@ ation ...
... known as the stars of kikan .
every 3000 years , the stars would align ...
... opening a portal to a world of unknown power .
he became immortal ...
... but at a price .
his brotherhood was turned to stone .
and upon the portal 's opening ...
... 13 monsters were released into our world .
the warrior king was left to eter@@ na@@ lly walk the earth ...
... un@@ able to die or forget his horri@@ ble mistake .
and the monsters that were un@@ lea@@ shed ...
... continue to plague man@@ kind to this very day .
monsters .
no .
we appreciate the generous donation ...
... for the continued protection of your village .
after all , the jungle can be a very dangerous place .
ma@@ ma ! - oh , she is dangerous .
there 's monsters out there .
watch where you 're going .
there 's a log on the road , se ? or .
well , if you 're not too busy , re@@ move it .
who are you ? show yourself .
the ghost of the jung@@ le. he puni@@ shes those who prey upon the weak .
he 's coming .
i just remembered i left the sto@@ ve on. my wife ha@@ tes that .
co@@ ward. get back here . - you 're on your own , je@@ fe .
show yourself. do you realize who you 're dealing with ?
what is this ... ? what ?
i am not afraid of a myth .
i 'm not afraid of a ghost .
what are you ?
it 's a mi@@ rac@@ le .
the ghost of the jungle .
there. that 's where i saw him .
thank you .
you 'd better get home now .
do you know the ghost ?
he wasn 't always a ghost .
hello ?
is anyone here ?
hello ?
it 's a long way from the city to just drop in .
you came all the way down here to look for me ?
actually , i was already here on business .
but then the lo@@ cal legend started soun@@ ding familiar ...
... so i decided to sno@@ op around .
what kind of business ? - anci@@ ent arti@@ facts .
some ty@@ co@@ on with too much time on his hands ...
... has his heart set on a colle@@ ction of 3000 @-@ year @-@ old statues .
well , you always did run with a strange crowd , april .
yeah , well. our strange crowd hasn 't been the same without you .
things aren 't looking so good back home .
how bad could it be ?
donnie 's probably got everything under control .
sir ? sir. sir .
did you turn the compu@@ ter on ? have you p@@ lu@@ gged it in ?
yeah , that would help .
no , i 'm not playing hard to get .
i 'm telling you , sir , it 's not that kind of phone line .
i 'm not your en@@ e@@ my. i 'm just donnie , your friendly it tech support ...
... here to help you 24 hours a day , sir .
yeah , i 'm sorry. ma 'am .
but donnie 's a gen@@ i@@ us. why would he take a job like that ?
at least he 's keeping busy .
well , if he 's doing that , who 's keeping an eye on mikey ?
mi@@ ke 's gotten into the enter@@ tain@@ ment business .
yeah .
happy birthday from cowabunga carl .
take it easy , little dudes. i bruise easily .
hey , black @-@ and @-@ blue cla@@ shes with green , dudes. hey , that 's ...
he 's a big hit .
all right. let 's hear it. what 's raph doing ?
no one really kno@@ ws. he just slee@@ ps all day .
well , what 's he do all night ?
2802 , 2802 , burglary in pro@@ gre@@ ss at 5@@ 5th and bro@@ ad@@ way .
suspects consi@@ dered armed and dangerous .
time to p@@ unch in .
good work , boy@@ s. that was easier than i thought it was gonna be .
hey , look , guys. i grab@@ bed a to@@ a@@ ster .
i love your work eth@@ ic , tom@@ my. it 's an inspiration to us all .
what was that ?
what 's going on , guys ?
what in the ... ?
looks like it 's just you and me , sha@@ ky .
take it ea@@ s@@ y. i 'm not gonna hurt you ...
... much .
i love when they play hard to get .
the nightwatcher .
he 's doing our job for us again . - tommy .
keep your hands to yourself . - hey , who 's tick@@ ling me ?
your training period ended a year ago .
and splinter says you don 't write anymore .
splinter sent me down here to become a better leader .
i can 't go back a failure .
besides , these people need me more than my brothers do .
if master splinter were here ...
... he would ask you , " what is your heart telling you ?
i don 't know. i just know something 's missing .
your brothers need you , leo .
they 're lost without you .
why skate a hal@@ f@@ pipe when you can skate a sewer pipe ?
sewer 's up , bra .
hey .
cowabunga .
dude. going down .
yeah .
here 's mikey .
guys ?
anyone ?
hello ?
whatever .
this place used to be fun .
and with rocke@@ ting interest rates , that 's bad news for homeowners ...
... as the real @-@ estate market continu@@ es its down@@ ward spira@@ l .
coming up , the vigilante known as nightwatcher stri@@ kes again .
now , i can 't say for sure , but he was definitely an alien .
i think it 's a dis@@ gr@@ ace , taking the law into your own hands like that .
leave it to the police . - up next ...
i remember how that used to feel , bu@@ sting up crime syn@@ di@@ cates .
sure , they had a bunch of guns , but they weren 't like these guns .
why do you do this to yourself , mikey ? those gl@@ ory days are over .
forget about them. get on with your li@@ fe. con@@ centra@@ te on your work .
yeah , yeah. spo@@ ken like a true has @-@ been .
well , look who woke up .
i suppose you think the nightwatcher is some kind of hero .
beats sitting around doing nothing while dir@@ t@@ ba@@ gs run free .
i would love to know what it is that you do that 's so great .
we 're con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting around here. all you do is sleep .
yeah , i do nothing. you 're right. you got me all figured out .
i know that your attitude has been a sour@@ ce of con@@ ten@@ tion to this team .
you think fear is the best way to accompli@@ sh things .
first of all , this team you speak of doesn 't exist anymore .
and second of all ...
enough .
i think i made my point .
that doesn 't prove anything .
why couldn 't you send him away for training ?
don@@ ate@@ llo , this home has become like an empty shell .
each of your brothers has streng@@ ths and weaknesses .
you must learn to be strong when they are weak .
if you don 't learn to recognize this ...
... then all hope is lost for our family .
keep it coming .
hey , careful .
those aren 't sou@@ venirs .
sorry about that , ma 'am .
where are you , casey ?
come on. come on , pick up .
don 't do this to me again. not now .
casey can 't come to the phone right now because we 're hardly working .
this better be good .
casey , i am standing on the do@@ ck with a pri@@ ce@@ less statu@@ e and no delivery truck .
so my question is , where are you ? - april .
hey , babe. i am so sorry. i set the al@@ arm clock , but ...
it 's brok@@ en. the clock ...
it 's bad enough that you 're out every night playing vigilante ...
... but we 've got a dea@@ d@@ line to meet . - i 'm sorry .
oh , wait , babe , real quic@@ k. you left a message saying you found leo .
i mean , is he there with you ? - no .
i found him. he 's not coming back .
but didn 't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the turtles ?
look , casey , we 're gonna lose the biggest client we have ...
... if you don 't get down here .
all right. i 'm on my way .
please tell me we 're getting paid by the p@@ ound here .
is this place a mus@@ e@@ um or what ?
you 've never heard of winterscorp ? - that 's what i 'm telling you .
they 're into everything : real estate , tech@@ no@@ logy , p@@ har@@ ma@@ ce@@ uti@@ cals , hair gel .
i don 't wear hair gel . - really ?
i 'm the ca@@ veman type , a@@ u natu@@ rel .
just make sure you don 't touch anything in here .
hey , i was born careful .
hope that wasn 't expen@@ sive .
oh , wait ... just ... i 'm ...
oh , boy . - please tell me that wasn 't you .
mr. winters . - miss o 'neil .
all the pieces are coming together .
oh , my. this is my associ@@ ate , casey .
nice to meet you , ken@@ ny . - boy@@ friend. it 's casey .
so you were su@@ c@@ ce@@ ss@@ ful ? - yes. the fourth general .
i want to ask you before i go ...
... if i could take one last look ?
i believe this is the one they call general a@@ ke@@ ela ?
it 's actually " aguila , " but that was a good try .
these statues may appear to be only stone ...
... but they 're like family to me. i didn 't choose them .
friends you can choose , but never your family .
okay , then .
take care , mr. winters .
if you 've come to kill me , could you make it fast ?
i 've got a shar@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ' meeting at 1@@ 0. i 'd rather miss it .
if we had come here to hurt you , you 'd be hur@@ ting already .
the foot clan and i have come to hear your offer .
well , it appears that today is my lucky day .
i must warn you , we do not come chea@@ p .
does it look like money is of any concern to me ?
only time is of the e@@ ss@@ ence , my dear .
since you 're so ri@@ ch and powerful ...
... what is it we could possibly have to offer you ?
i need you to be my eyes and ears .
i have some friends coming to town ...
... that i 'd like to roll out the red carpet for .
gre@@ et them warmly and bring them to me .
and how will we know these friends ?
don 't worry , they 're impossible to miss .
and you keep them up. got that ?
and don 't let me catch you calling the cops .
what ? not again .
didn 't i take care of you last week ?
hey. oh , no. come on , now. wait .
i 'm very disappointed in you , k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ head .
guess night school 's in session .
hope i 'm not distur@@ bing class .
hey , nightwatcher , need any teaching assi@@ stan@@ ts ?
oh , no. casey .
i got this one covered , pal. thanks , but no , thanks .
you think you own these roof@@ to@@ ps ? i happen to think you could use my help .
and i could use a sidekick .
you may have everyone else fooled , but you haven 't fooled me , raph .
yeah , well , guess what , pal. now you ...
hey , wait a minute. how did you know it was me ?
wasn 't that hard , man. you know , you look like a big , metal turtle .
it 's that obvi@@ ous , huh ?
i should 've sta@@ yed in law school . - ain 't that cute ? he 's trying to get away .
well , looks like i got a sidekick .
yeah , right. you 're the sidekick .
what , is it perform@@ ance ar@@ t ? i don 't get it . - what was i supposed to do ...
... sit around , wait for leo to come back and save the day ?
i mean , we haven 't heard word one from him ...
... since splinter sent him away on his little vacation .
you think these low@@ lif@@ es take vacations at the first sign of pressure ?
no. the criminal ele@@ ment of this city may be guilty of a lot of things ...
... but being qu@@ it@@ ters ain 't one of them .
you know , i don 't even care about leo anymore .
kind of hope he never comes back .
come on , aren 't you being a little hard on the guy ?
i don 't know. it 's possible .
i guess if i could live anywhere other than the city , i 'd go too .
but i could never leave this place .
i can 't even sleep without the sound of the sub@@ way ru@@ mbling over my head .
i guess it comes from gro@@ wing up with a house@@ ful of brothers .
i 'm not trying to tell you what to do .
i 'm just saying that if it was my brother , i 'd find a way to work it out .
but that 's just me .
i got my own issu@@ es , you know ? like back at home , with april .
there 's this whole thing about se@@ tt@@ ling down ...
... that makes me miss the old times .
i don 't know if i can be the gro@@ wnup she needs me to be .
good talk , raph .
arise , my brother@@ s. arise , dear sister .
the stars of kikan align .
all ye generals , wake from your stone slu@@ mber .
dude .
dude .
enter .
kneel , my son .
i return from my training , master .
i was so caught up in my own world , i forgot about everyone else .
i 'm sorry i failed .
on the contr@@ ary , my son ...
... now you are much stron@@ ger .
your streng@@ th is needed here now .
you owe me no apo@@ logy , but perhaps you should talk to raphael .
your ab@@ sen@@ ce has been par@@ ti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly difficult for him ...
... though he 'll never admit it .
i 'm certain things will be back to normal in no time , master .
good. because until you can act as one , you are forbidden to fight .
yes , sensei .
i have missed you , leonardo .
i 've missed you too , father .
your brother is home .
hey . - hey .
welcome home .
yeah. thanks .
well , i 'm going to bed .
hey , leo 's back. better go say hello before he leaves again .
what ? leo . - hey .
hey . - huh , leo ?
is that really you ? - yeah .
i 'm , like , dreaming , aren 't i ? - no , mikey , you 're not dreaming .
oh , good. i have night@@ mar@@ es about birthday par@@ ties .
okay , leo , i 'll bit@@ e. what are we doing up here ?
i told splinter i 'd get this team in shape again .
hey , i 've been training. since you left , my video @-@ game scor@@ es have , like , doubled .
right , and while you 've been playing games , brother ...
... nightwatcher 's come into the neighborhood ...
... like some kind of vigilante show@@ bo@@ at. but his days are done .
hey , you went a@@ wol , leo ...
... and the nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the s@@ lack .
crime never took a break. you did .
i heard his bike turns into a plane or , like , a jetp@@ ack .
hey , don , you 're so smart , why don 't we have jetpacks ?
that 's good , mi@@ ke@@ y. i don 't even trust you with a driver 's license .
have you seen the way this guy beha@@ ves ...
someone 's c@@ ran@@ ky .
okay , jungle bo@@ y. grab a v@@ ine . - raph , wait .
splinter told us not to fight .
jungle boy . " good one .
all right. but remember , we 're only up here for training .
you know what i always say , " train by doing , dude .
mikey , when have you ever said that ?
you smell that ? it 's like a monkey cage up here .
wow , good news is , there 's a bunch of foot ninjas ...
... getting the s@@ not kicked out of them .
bad news is , this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon .
yeah , so ? you think we should help these guys ?
i 'd rather enjoy the sho@@ w. what do you say , fearless leader ?
we 're not ... - i say we stop talking .
come here , fuzzy wuzzy .
you .
i think we 're getting off on the wrong foot here .
we 're trying to help you . - never .
team .
wait , the shredder 's dead .
who are you working for ?
hey , a little help , o fearless one .
that was too easy .
like i said , too easy .
bad dog .
look at me. found the elevator .
oh , my shoulder .
my sp@@ le@@ en .
this place needed a sky@@ light .
this is why we need jetpacks .
okay , any more b@@ right ideas ? - how about this ?
when this is over , i 'm totally calling the arch@@ ite@@ ct .
wait a minute. how did something that big just disa@@ pp@@ ear ? it doesn 't ...
dude , it 's the cops .
oh , yeah. the turtles are back , dudes .
i give us a 10 for style , an eight for s@@ kill ...
... and a two for stea@@ lth .
what seems to be the problem ?
the problem is that we were hired to mer@@ ely pat@@ rol the city ...
... and report anything strange to you .
you never said anything about monsters .
now , i 'm sorry that your ill@@ u@@ stri@@ ous group have been redu@@ ced to hired guns ...
... but i believe we made a deal , karai .
and i expect you to honor it .
you do understand honor , don 't you ?
so how did we f@@ are ?
my , my , my. and what is your name ?
were there any problems , general ?
none , my lord .
then show these foo@@ ls how a true warrior ac@@ ts .
keep them on schedule in comple@@ ting their ta@@ sk .
we do not need any help .
never@@ the@@ less , karai , i trust my family more than i trust you .
you may be the eyes and ears , but they are the mus@@ cle .
they will help you ga@@ ther the rema@@ in@@ ing 12 of these ab@@ om@@ in@@ ations ...
... so we can finally see our birth@@ rights fu@@ l@@ fi@@ lled .
it 's going to be quite a party .
dudes , did anyone get the license pla@@ te of that thing that hit us last night ?
my head .
okay , that was just weird. i mean , first the foot , then that hi@@ de@@ ous monster .
yeah. it looked like your mom , dude .
yeah , that would make her your mom too , d@@ oo@@ f@@ us .
yeah , whatever .
keep laugh@@ ing. last night was an embarrass@@ ment .
i 'll tell you what 's embarrass@@ ing. you can 't follow a single order .
oh , how cu@@ te. you 've been back for five minutes ...
... and now you 're schoo@@ ling us on your master plan ?
okay , so this is my fault now , huh , raph ?
i 'm the only one that has to be responsible ?
hey , you 're the trained master , not me .
dudes , can it. here comes splinter .
good morning , my sons .
good morning , sensei . - su@@ p ?
every ninja 's day should start with a healthy brea@@ k@@ fast .
it fi@@ lls me with pri@@ de to see you boys together again .
if anyone needs me , i 'll be watching my stories .
ho@@ thea@@ d . - splinter j@@ r .
co@@ dy is going to break up with don@@ na@@ . i just know it .
we interrupt the gi@@ l@@ more girls for this special news report .
monsters loose in the city ?
strange repor@@ ts are coming in about an incident ...
... that sounds like something out of science fic@@ tion .
boys !
leonardo , i am most disappointed in you .
you are the el@@ de@@ st of your brothers .
i was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family .
this is why i have forbidden any surface ac@@ tiv@@ ity .
we cannot return to the surface to fight evil ...
... if we continue to fight each other .
but master splinter , how can i be expected to do so ...
there are no exc@@ uses when you are the leader , my student .
we have to go out and find who 's responsible for this .
there ain 't no other solution .
save the bru@@ te @-@ vigilante junk for that nightwatch@@ man .
nightwatcher . - nightwatcher .
yeah , whatever .
i 'm going out .
witnesses say there are holes in the flo@@ ors ...
... as if something or someone had just bla@@ sted straight down through them ...
... leaving authori@@ ties scratching their heads .
well , at least some people care about justice these days .
hey , casey .
raph ? - meet me on the roof , okay ?
what is it ?
the roof. you know what the roof is , don 't you ?
pushy sidekick .
we 've gotten this i@@ mage in from an amateur camer@@ a@@ man ...
... and i do stress " amateur .
casey , come look at this .
be safe .
what 's this all about , raph ?
we got bigger things to worry about than criminals .
like what ?
come on .
i think we lost it .
it 's gotta be around here somewhere .
i don 't think so .
what 's going on , raph ?
did i mention we ran into a monster last night ?
no , you kind of failed to tell me about that one , buddy .
you do know i only have a wooden b@@ at , don 't you ?
the foot ? i thought they were history .
and now we got walking statues ? you got a plan for those ?
yeah. hey , those are a first for me too .
and who knows ? these guys might be friendly .
friendly .
wait a second. those statues look ...
witnesses .
watch out .
i don 't feel so good .
that can 't be good .
that 's just rude .
hey , wait up .
raph ? - come here .
what , you never heard of smoke pellets ? - warn me next time .
i got allergies .
come on. that 's the second mask this week .
they 'll never find us in here .
stay with me , now. we 'll be out of here soon .
no .
and i thought girl sc@@ ou@@ ts were pushy .
some people just can 't take a hint .
this is the police. you on the roof , put your hands behind your ...
what is that ? tommy , you see this ?
yeah , you better run .
i gotta hand it to you , raph ...
... you sure know how to show a lady a good time .
oh , no. i gotta get you someplace safe , pal .
my compli@@ ments to the che@@ f .
anyone for de@@ ss@@ er@@ t ?
no . - yes .
cowabunga carl party servic@@ e@@ s. cowabunga , dude .
raph 's hur@@ t. you need to get over here . - s@@ low down , april .
what happened to raph ? - i don 't know. he 's unconscious .
we 'll be right there .
leo. you came back .
sorry the re@@ uni@@ on isn 't under better circumstances .
nice pa@@ d , kids .
oh , hey , raph .
well , his v@@ ital signs seem to be okay .
pu@@ pi@@ l di@@ lation is normal .
some sort of st@@ one. probably ob@@ si@@ di@@ an , i think .
well , is he gonna be all right ?
you 're still here ? go back to your jungle .
well , at least his person@@ ality 's still int@@ act .
and there 's an en@@ gra@@ ving on it. looks south american .
that 's your department , april .
would it help if i told you that those statues you collected for winters ...
... were shooting these things at me and raph ?
the legend of yoatl . " it can 't be .
it was just a myth ...
... a scary story the lo@@ cals told kids around a ca@@ mp@@ fire .
whoa , what are you talking about ?
they say 3000 years ago , some great warrior ...
... actually found a portal to another di@@ men@@ sion .
and when the portal opened ...
... the energy from it gave the warrior eter@@ nal life .
but it also turned his generals to stone .
what if this warrior just kept living forever ?
he would spend the rest of his days in re@@ gre@@ t ...
... spending all of his ri@@ ches and all of his power ...
... to find a way to re@@ vive his stone generals .
maybe , just maybe ...
... he 's buil@@ t a new emp@@ i@@ re .
but , hey , like i said , it 's just a myth .
if you ask me , guys , this has winters ' name written all over it .
how do you figure that , donnie ? - yeah .
because this has winters ' name written all over it .
now i know who to thank for this shot in the arm .
so where do we find this guy and his stone jo@@ kers ?
we 're not going until we get splinter 's ble@@ ssing .
you 're gonna quo@@ te a ru@@ le@@ book to me that you ain 't been following for a year ?
if you got something you wanna get off your shell , now 's the time .
but i 'm not gonna stand here and debate splinter 's orders with you .
fine , th@@ en. i quit .
hey , rap@@ h. don 't do it , man .
sometimes just taking a brea@@ ther is the best thing to do .
whatever .
to picking up the pieces .
what is it ?
two creatures remain , my lord .
well , by all means , then , let 's finish it .
and you will finally be free of your stone prison .
but if the curse is broken , we will no longer be immortal .
brother , do not question my command .
here we go , now . - so , what are we looking for ?
well , according to these star char@@ ts , the portal is set to open ...
... directly over winters tower in the next 24 hours .
so the legend is right. three thous@@ and years .
and when the portal open@@ s , we 'll lose the city to monsters within hours .
within days , the coun@@ tr@@ y. and within weeks , the world .
oh , so it 's like hall@@ ey 's com@@ et , only monsters come out ?
yes. i guess so .
i 'm smart .
i 'm okay .
why do we need raph , anyway ?
it 's his temper that always je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ zes all our mi@@ ssions .
okay , leo. whatever you say. nobody was talking about him .
leonardo , this team you are so eager to lead is in@@ complete .
you know what you must do .
yes , sensei .
generals , i think our brother has plans to betray us .
the 13th monster must not be found .
why don 't we take one more call about these monster sightings ?
suff@@ ern , new jersey , you 're on .
monster sightings .
a monster !
attention , all on @-@ duty offic@@ ers :
report of a disturbance on 3@@ 2@@ n@@ d. no units a@@ vailable .
they 're playing my song .
where are the cops ? how come the cops haven 't shown up ?
just remember what my analy@@ st said , just go to my happy place .
everything 's gonna be fine. happy place. i 'm feeling good. i 'm thin .
don 't get up. i 'll ser@@ ve myself .
look at you. ain 't you cute ?
you want a bu@@ tt @-@ kicking , little fella ? yes , you do. you do .
come on , i 'm gonna drop @-@ kick you to hur@@ ty town@@ . come on , little guy .
get off of me , you little monster .
you 're scratching the hel@@ met .
okay , that was different .
hey , this thing ain 't ru@@ st@@ p@@ roof. get off of me .
come on .
how about a sn@@ ack , little fella ?
catch .
keep on running , you filthy little her@@ mit cra@@ b .
that sp@@ ic@@ y mea@@ t@@ ball 's on the house .
big guy , please don 't hurt me .
what ? i 'm not robbing you , i 'm helping you .
okay , whatever you say , sir. please , i got kids in college .
community college .
here you go , pal. make sure this is safe .
take every@@ thing. i 'm not even look@@ ing. go .
why is it everyone 's got such a hard time believ@@ ing i am a good guy ?
i just sa@@ ved your life .
this night just keeps getting better and better .
get off my car .
i want you to know that i appreciate your inten@@ tions ...
... but you can 't change the world like this .
the road you 're on is a dead end . - is he kidding ?
i 've tried it . - he 's le@@ c@@ turing .
so i 'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away ...
... and stop this vigilante nonsense .
okay , leo ...
... time to tea@@ ch you a lesson .
look , trust me when i tell you , you don 't wanna do this .
oh , yeah. well , i notice you got quite a temper .
hey , have you ever done this before ?
oh , come on. you call that an attack ?
all right. finally , some excitement .
funny thing about anger :
let it con@@ sume you , and soon enough ...
... you lose sight of everything .
good night , dark pr@@ ince .
what ?
you are so s@@ mu@@ g , you know that ?
you think the world rev@@ ol@@ ves around you , don 't you ?
we couldn 't survi@@ ve without the mi@@ gh@@ ty and powerful leonardo ...
... to gui@@ de us through our problems .
well , i got a news fla@@ sh for you : we got along just fine without you .
oh , and this quali@@ fi@@ es as " just fine " ? dressing up like it 's hall@@ o@@ ween every night ?
ris@@ king the safety of our family ? i mean , come on , what were you thinking ?
don 't push it. you can 't leave and come back ...
... expecting us to fall in line like your little sol@@ di@@ ers .
hey , i was training. training to be a better leader , for you .
why do you hate me for that ? - and whoever said i wanted to be led ?
i 'm better off calling my own shots now. get used to it .
you aren 't rea@@ dy. you 're im@@ patient and hot @-@ tempered .
and more impor@@ tan@@ tly , i 'm better than you .
oh , you know something , big brother ?
i 'd have to disa@@ gree with you on that one .
don 't do this , raph .
i 'm done taking orders .
not human ...
... but clearly not the final monster .
yoatl won 't know the differ@@ ence .
by the time our brother disco@@ vers this turtle is not the 13th monster ...
... it will already be too late .
leo. hang on .
no !
raphael. what is the matter ?
i was out. i was out and i did ... i did something .
something happened and then l ... and i ...
raphael. kneel .
i did something .
i did something really stupid , master splinter .
go on .
i know why you cho@@ se him now .
i know that there 's a reason why he 's the better son and i 'm not .
raphael , you always bear the world 's problems on your shoulders .
it is an admi@@ r@@ able quality when you are a protec@@ tor of others .
but you must realize that while , at times , you may not be my favorite student ...
... it does not mean that you are my least @-@ favorite son .
you are strong , passionate and loyal to a fault .
these are the mer@@ its of a great leader as well ...
... but only when tempered with com@@ passion and hu@@ mi@@ lity .
but , master splinter , i messed up big tonight .
i mean big .
they took him .
yeah .
then the time for hiding is over .
we must return to the surface to take back what is ours .
by your wish , father .
long have we been in hid@@ ing. perhaps too long .
well , what do we do now ?
i 'll tell you what we 're gonna do .
we 're gonna re@@ sc@@ ue our brother , and then we 're gonna save new york city .
i got it on my last trip to j@@ ap@@ an. you like it ?
oh , yeah .
no way .
you can 't go tri@@ ck @-@ or @-@ treating without your mask .
oh , babe. thanks .
as ordered , no one gets into the tower ...
... no one interferes , no one bears witness .
you 've got to be kidding me .
cowabunga , dude. i 'm here for little max@@ ie 's 13th birthday party .
leave now .
oh , but you don 't understand , lady. i got ...
at la@@ st. after 3000 years , the time is finally at hand .
what ... ? what have you done ?
your time for giving orders is over .
you don 't understand .
i want to send these creatures back ...
... to un@@ do the damage that was done so many years ago .
time has done nothing but made you weak .
we have our own plans .
immorta@@ lity is a curse , brother .
trust me , i 've lived long enough to know .
we have to find that 13th mon@@ st@@ er. it 's time to end it .
no .
our time is just beginning .
little help , don . - i 'm on it .
heads up , dudes .
go@@ al .
guys , front door 's open@@ . now .
two minutes for high stic@@ king .
dudes , that rocke@@ d. let 's go again .
dudes , what do we do ? - i 'm working on it .
you break it , you buy it .
yeah. all right .
all right. nice .
nice work , jones . - i have my moments .
whoa , check it out .
that would be the swi@@ r@@ ling vortex to another world , i assume .
cool. i want one .
leo , is that you ?
sorry , wrong cage .
leo. i got him . - out of the way , please .
hey , bu@@ ddy. come on , man. up we go .
there you go .
you 're gonna need these if you 're gonna lead us out of here .
i 'm gonna need you too .
winters . - looks more like fa@@ ll. get it ?
mikey , remember our talk .
looks like someone got to him before us .
is he dead ?
not so immortal , huh , dudes ?
your time 's run out , winters .
miss o 'neil .
i must have hit my head pretty har@@ d. i 'm seeing gi@@ ant turtles .
we know what you 're up to , winters. we know about the portal ...
... and we think that it 's time you sent all these monsters home .
i couldn 't agree with you more .
it is time to put an end to the curse that i have brought upon myself ...
... and this world .
that 's what this is about , miss o 'neil : pen@@ ance .
i must return all 13 bea@@ sts or our curse will continue .
and that is a tor@@ ment i can no longer bear .
then you should be put out of your misery .
i think we walked in on a family fe@@ ud , guys .
the time has come to re@@ open the portal and rain destruction upon the earth .
nothing will stand in our way ...
... when we have an army at our command .
my brothers , l ... - we are no brothers to you .
with one monster still free , the curse will never be broken .
we sha@@ ll finish what we began all those years ago .
and we will finally have our victory .
join us. join us , foot clan .
swear your alle@@ gi@@ ance to us and no har@@ m will be@@ fall you .
the foot ninja is not without hon@@ or. we work for winters , not you .
okay , what does that mean ?
it means we 're going to help you .
my ninja will find the last monster and you will bring it back here .
hurry , we don 't have much time .
hey. i got shotgun .
forget about them .
by the time they return , the portal will already be closed ...
... with you inside it .
i hate to see brothers fight like this .
unless it 's together .
hate to rain on your parade , pal , but we thought we 'd even the odds .
we 're going to enjoy this .
if you please. they can de@@ fe@@ at them .
they are a team .
let 's hope so , because if not , aguila will use the portal ...
... to draw for@@ th an army of evil and the world will be lost .
more bea@@ st@@ s. let 's send them back where they belong .
temper , temper .
come to da@@ ddy .
thing about you immortal stone guys is ...
... you know , you 're immortal and made of stone .
i sound like mikey .
you fight well. you should join us .
no , thanks , i 'm good .
these guys really don 't di@@ e. sensei , are you all right ?
we must do this more often .
i still got it .
they 'd better hurry with that last monster .
i 'm sure my man casey 's got it all under control .
that 's what i 'm afraid of .
can 't this piece of junk go fa@@ ster ?
wanna drive ? - i would , as a matter of fact .
you would think they would be more concer@@ ned about the 13th monster .
boys , we must finish this now .
so did we win ?
foo@@ lish crea@@ tu@@ res. we are immor@@ tals made of stone .
without the final monster to break our curse ...
... we will never be stopped .
special delivery .
look out .
so did we win now ?
yeah , i think we did . - we won .
all right . - yeah !
all right. that 's what i 'm talking about .
yeah !
nice par@@ all@@ el parking .
next time , i 'm driving .
hey. watch the hair .
ty@@ pi@@ ca@@ l. we do all the work , he gets all the thanks .
you are every bit the warriors i was infor@@ med you were .
you have passed .
sa@@ vor your victory tonight .
for soon , we will have further business together .
the kind that invol@@ ves familiar faces from your past .
she doesn 't mean ...
come on. what is it with ninjas and smoke pellets ?
looks like you picked a good time to come home .
thanks for bringing me back .
i 'm never usually that happy to be in pain .
he 's happy because he 's mor@@ tal again , mikey .
apri@@ l. i 've had my eye on you for a long time .
i knew it .
i 've always known that you 'd be the one to help me find my way home .
and thank you ...
... brothers .
you 've made a very old man very , very happy .
so , what happens now ?
okay. just a little bit cre@@ e@@ py .
oh , gross. i think he 's in my no ... my no ... my no ...
gross. somebody give me a han@@ kie .
now he 's in my mouth .
tast@@ es awful .
you got room for one more ?
can i get rid of this too ?
we live together. we train together .
we fight together. we stand for good , together .
we are ninjas .
we stri@@ ke hard , defend , protect , and fa@@ de into the night .
and there ain 't no bad guy or monster gonna ever change that .
that 's what 's important .
and that 's why we 'll always be brothers .
oh , i love being a turtle .

that 's about $ 350 , 00@@ 0. your lucky day .
i have a pro@@ position for you. why don 't you stick around ?
we 're gonna put you upstairs in a su@@ ite on us .
you can eat up , clean up , and then come back down here in a few hours and take us for everything we got .
how does that sound ?
no , i 'd like to cash out ... now .
excuse me .
who are you ?
do you know what time it is ? - i 'm sorry ?
it 's 8 : 00 a. m@@ .@@ as in the gra@@ ve@@ yard shift ended two hours ago .
you realize that , right ? this body is , is mine .
i 'm not going to get into a tur@@ f war with you right now .
because you 'll lose .
look , don 't make me call your super@@ visor .
oh , too la@@ te. and you are ...
sea@@ n yeager , day shift .
yeah , your super@@ visor spea@@ ks very high@@ ly of you .
you 're a csi @-@ 2 , right ?
yeah , one solve away from a pro@@ motion ? - yes , sir .
you know , i never cared much for this day shift ver@@ su@@ s night shift crap .
i mean , we 're all one crime lab , right ? all for one , one for all .
okay , look , cards on the table here .
i really do need this solve to be a sol@@ o .
i hate to break it to you , yeager , but i don 't think this is the game @-@ chan@@ ger that you 're looking for .
home@@ less guy assa@@ ul@@ ted in an alle@@ y. looks like a trash run .
yeah ?
i 'm not so sure about that .
yeah , i think i 'm with you .
why , do you got something ?
uh , my wife bar@@ bar@@ a is stran@@ ded at the airport , needs a li@@ ft .
so you should go pick her up. we 'll take care of this .
the two of you work together ?
i think that 's a great idea .
don 't you think ?
like you said , all for one and one for all .
whe@@ w , this guy is ri@@ pe , and i don 't think it 's de@@ com@@ p .
i think he just may have really needed a sho@@ wer .
he 's got dirty clothes , got wea@@ ther@@ ed skin .
he 's been living on the stre@@ ets for quite a while , you can tell .
you get a wallet , da@@ vi@@ d ?
no wa@@ lle@@ t-- i checked .
yeager , come on , man , you know the protoco@@ l .
you can 't touch my body without my authori@@ z@@ ation .
i didn 't touch your body .
i saw a wear pattern on the back pock@@ et with no lu@@ mp@@ . no lu@@ mp , no wallet .
i figure the guy gets mu@@ gged , the att@@ ack@@ er ri@@ f@@ les through the wallet and to@@ sses it in the n@@ ea@@ rest trash recep@@ tac@@ le .
hey , i 'm not in here for my hea@@ lth .
you 've been in there for a whi@@ le. you found a wallet yet ?
i 'm working on it .
hey , uh , li@@ ver te@@ mp was 9@@ 1 . 1 , which puts time of death at around 3 : 00 this morning .
i count 12 sharp @-@ force injuries with a two @-@ in@@ ch bla@@ de .
stabbed in the back .
i know how he feels .
you know what ? when we close this case , you can have the solve .
thanks , but i don 't need your charity .
case ... in point .
blood says it 's related .
empty .
what is home@@ less guy doing with the mission : impossible briefcase ?
so much for your trash run .
got blood dro@@ ps .
looks like the assa@@ ult started right here .
our victim is hea@@ ding down the alley , he gets att@@ acked from behind .
the assa@@ il@@ ant grab@@ s the briefcase , stea@@ ls what 's inside .
but these blood s@@ mea@@ rs and dra@@ g marks say that it didn 't end there .
the killer sees his victim still alive , trying to cra@@ w@@ l away , so he dra@@ gs him out of sight , fini@@ shes him off .
you know , you see that blood on his finger and under his hand ?
weird , right ?
what do you suppose that means ?
well , maybe it 's a , a message , you know , last words to a loved one .
or , if it were me , my dying breath , i 'd try to identi@@ fy my killer .
i see you 're not the sen@@ ti@@ men@@ tal ty@@ pe. okay , i like that .
oh , boy , honey , i 'm so sorry. problem solved .
con@@ ra@@ d wanted me to re@@ schedule a hearing .
it 's okay , i get it , i know you 're a very busy person .
that 's why i said i would take a taxi from the airport .
no , no , i told you i wanted to take you home@@ . i 'm gonna , i 'm gonna take you home .
sit first .
have something to ea@@ t. these pa@@ stri@@ es are good .
pa@@ st@@ ry ? no , i@@ -- ah , i 'm sorry , i can '@@ t-- couldn 't possibly ...
i wi@@ ll@@ -- let me have a hit of that coffee , th@@ ou@@ gh@@ . thanks .
i 'm sorry , really , i ...
how are you ? how was seattle ?
maya and ka@@ ti@@ e are both doing very well , and r@@ y@@ an talked with his company and worked it out so he can stay home more .
that 's good .
have you talked to char@@ lie ?
it 's been crazy around here. i know i got a couple of messa@@ ges from him .
is there something i should know ?
well , there 's something
oh , come on , come on , that 's not fai@@ r. i promise i 'll act surprised .
what ? what ?
he 's gotten an offer from ea@@ st@@ ern indi@@ ana@@ -- full sc@@ hol@@ ar@@ ship , starting point guard .
is he gonna take it ?
well , i think so .
well , that is news .
it 's great , it 's just that , you know ...
one of the rea@@ sons why we took this job was so we could be , you know , near char@@ lie , watch him play his games .
i think getting away could be good for him .
i know. i know .
i just didn 't expect it , that 's all .
things change , plans change .
that sounds like another discus@@ sion we need to have .
yeah , but at another time .
i can tell you 're busy , s@@ wee@@ th@@ ear@@ t , and i can take a taxi .
hey , do@@ c , got your messa@@ ge@@ . you have something for me ?
yeah , still working on our alley joh@@ n doe , but i found this in one of the wound trac@@ ts .
maybe a piece of the murder weapon .
tip of the bla@@ de@@ -- maybe it broke off@@ . i 'll get it to ho@@ dges .
tell me some@@ thing@@ -- these wound patt@@ er@@ ns ... i admit sometimes cases start to blu@@ r together , but i could swear i have seen this somewhere before .
well , the two wounds in the center , close@@ st to the sp@@ ine , appear dee@@ per and wider .
almost like the killer twisted the bla@@ de .
yeah , but the rest of the wounds are clean , sharp .
that could be over@@ kill , ra@@ ge .
or something el@@ se@@ -- a signatu@@ re .
i 'll pull some case files , see what i can find .
thanks .
well , don 't you look like a lo@@ v@@ ely couple .
let me gue@@ ss. you 're in the market for a ring ?
information , ac@@ tu@@ all@@ y. i am csi bro@@ dy , and this is csi yeager .
i take it you 're ruby .
yes , but ... if this is police business , i must confe@@ ss , i 'm just the name on the door .
my boys run the store now .
i just come in occasionally to help out .
keeps me out of trouble .
little help up front .
coming , ma@@ . what 's up ?
well , these very nice , uh , police folks would like to talk to you about something .
i 'll be in the back if you need me .
oh , and , honey , don 't let him get away .
we recovered this pawn ticket .
looks like it 's from one of your customers last night .
we just need a name .
hey , what 's this about ?
well , that wasn 't the question .
this is time @-@ sta@@ mped 11 : 4@@ 9 .
why don 't you look that up ?
uh , our compu@@ ters are down right now , so ...
uh , 11 : 4@@ 9 ?
pla@@ id shirt , t @-@ shirt , je@@ ans , sme@@ lled ba@@ d. farami watch .

i made a co@@ py of his driver 's license , too .
200 bu@@ cks for a farami watch and a gold ring ?
i can see you 're , uh , real generous .
it 's a se@@ cur@@ ed lo@@ an. guy doesn 't come back for it , that 's on him .
you sure it 's just on him ?
here you go .
thank you .
you mind if i hold on@@ to this ?
uh , yeah , su@@ re. i always make a du@@ p@@ li@@ ca@@ te. you never know .
oh , and the watch and the r@@ ing. you guys still have those , right ?
yeah. we got ' em .
grea@@ t. we 'll take those to go .
wow , somebody had a good night .
yep , that 's jeremy sikes from last night from the eye @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sk@@ y from pike 's gambling hall .
this was distri@@ bu@@ ted to security at all the cas@@ in@@ os in town with a warning to keep a look@@ out for this guy .
why ? was he ca@@ using trouble ?
oh , the worst kin@@ d. at least in vegas .
our friend here took his $ 200 from ruby 's pawn shop , walked into pike 's and 3@@ 7 hands , 4@@ 5 minutes later , he had $ 350 , 000 .
well , at least we know why he had that briefcase .
$ 200 tur@@ ning into 350 grand@@ -- come on , what are the odds of that ?
i 'd say somewhere in the ran@@ ge of being ea@@ ten by a sh@@ ark while being stru@@ ck by light@@ ning .
the casino , obviously , thought that he was cheating .
car@@ d counting ?
no , the be@@ tting pattern was off .
they suspe@@ cted coll@@ usi@@ on with his dealer , kristi holt , who , by the way , did not show up for work this morning .
you 're thinking that sikes and holt were sca@@ mming the casino .
and then holt stabbed sikes in the back@@ -- li@@ ter@@ all@@ y-- and ran off with the money .
interesting theory , but ...
look at th@@ at@@ -- sikes dre@@ w quite the crowd .
any one of them could 've follow@@ ed him back into the alley , right ?
my money 's still on the dealer .
that 's because you 're as@@ su@@ ming that they were cheating .
of course they cheated .
no , and sikes even tried to i. d. his killer in his own blood : " d @-@ e " spe@@ lls " dealer " to me .
look , for all we know , this is just one of those great vegas stories :
guy paw@@ ns his last pos@@ sessions , ne@@ ts it all and win@@ s .
the two of them are total strang@@ ers and it 's just a case of dumb luck .
i don 't believe in luck .
me , neither .
why ? what do you got ?
a connection ... between jeremy sikes and our dealer kristi holt .
the watch that sikes pawned for sta@@ ke money turned out to belong to kristi 's husband .
and here 's the kic@@ ker : her husband was murdered two months ago .
dumb luck , huh ?
i 'm thinking that maybe this casino he@@ ist isn 't the first time that kristi en@@ listed sikes to engage in a little dirty work .
two months ago , she has him murder her husband .
and , last night , after they both sca@@ m@@ med the casino , kristi kills sikes .
so it looks like we have this kristi holt dealing the death car@@ d@@ -- not just once , but twice .
yae@@ ger and i pulled the cold case file on the murder of simon holt , our blackjack dealer 's husband .
you and yae@@ ger@@ . nice to see you kids getting along .
yeah , well , let 's just be clear : i 'm ri@@ zz@@ ol@@ i and she 's is@@ les .
anyway , the case is still open .
and maybe open because day shift was investigating .
don 't look at me , okay ? i was on the swing shift then .
the night of the murder , kristi holt was questi@@ on@@ ed .
she said she finished up her shift at pike 's then left the casino to meet up with her husband simon .
they met for dinner , then got home around mid@@ night. she was really tired .
im@@ medi@@ ately went upstairs to bed and he went to the living room to watch the news .
and that 's when she heard two shots ring out .
she ran down@@ stairs and found her husband dead and the place was ran@@ s@@ acked .
so kristi holt 's story is that her husband walked in on some guy robbing the place .
now , in defen@@ se of day shift , it was a good story .
there was no reason to doubt it .
until last night ... when jeremy sikes turned up dead .
after paw@@ ning kristi holt 's husband 's watch , and going on one hell of a run at her blackjack table .
they say there are no co@@ in@@ ci@@ den@@ ces .
yeah , but ... sometimes there are .
yeah. right. dumb luck .
i thought we agre@@ ed that luck wasn 't a pla@@ yer in this .
all right , well , then , call it de@@ stin@@ y. or f@@ ate .
of all of the blackjack tab@@ les in all of the wor@@ ld@@ -- is that where you 're going with this ?
no , where i 'm going with this is there 's one person still alive who can answer these questions .
what , is that your wife again ?
no , someone else '@@ s. a wi@@ do@@ w , as a matter of fact .
bra@@ ss just picked up kristi holt .
if this is about what happened last night ,
i 'll tell you what i told bobby , my pit boss :
it was a straight @-@ up run. there was no cheat .
if we 're just talking about cheating here , then this is your lucky night .
now it 's my turn to deal .
your pal jeremy sikes .
oh , my god , wh@@ a ... that 's ... the gu@@ y. i ... is he ... ?
dead ? yeah .
but i think you know that .
how about i hit you again ? your husband simon .
this is the time in this gambling session , when you go b@@ ust .
or you play your ace in the ho@@ le and tell me the truth .
the truth ?
the truth is my husband was murdered when he walked in on a burglary .
you sure you want to stick with that story ?
it 's not a story . - yes , it is .
and you really ought to hang out with a better class of co @-@ con@@ spira@@ tor@@ -- or at least a smarter one —
because your pal jeremy pawned your husband 's watch for $ 200 and brought the money to the table —
that 's what sta@@ ked him in the game .
this guy ... had simon 's watch ?
yes .
if he had his watch , it must be because he stole it because he 's the one who broke in our house .
or there could be another explanation :
you could 've given it to him as a little thank @-@ you gift for killing your husband .
that 's sick ! i gave that watch to simon for our an@@ ni@@ versary !
yeah. we checked with farami .
it 's a special or@@ der@@ . around $ 2 , 000 .
so i , i looked at the insurance records , the claims and the police st@@ ate@@ ments , and ...
nowhere is there mention of a $ 2 , 000 watch .
my husband was murdered , detec@@ tiv@@ e. i forgot about the damn watch !
you didn 't forget about the insurance money .
which went to pay off simon 's deb@@ ts !
which is why you and jeremy doubled down at pike 's gambling hall , to the tun@@ e of $ 350 , 000 .
kristi , you know , you didn 't show up for work .
you end up at a mo@@ tel , hiding under the bed ... this doesn 't look good .
if you worked for old @-@ school guys at an old @-@ school casino like pike 's , and they thought you cheated them ... you 'd be la@@ ying low in a mo@@ tel , too .
and if this is the guy who broke in my house and killed my husband , then he deser@@ ved to die .
i didn 't kill him , and i didn 't have anything to do with cheating the casino last night , and if you don 't believe me , check the damn ta@@ pe , the cards , the shuff@@ l@@ er@@ -- i didn 't cheat !
what do you got ?
it looks like our dealer didn 't cheat .
says you. i 'm still not convinc@@ ed .
this guy went on an insane run. we saw the ta@@ pe .
he 's hitting when he shouldn 't , holding when he shouldn '@@ t-- the odds of that happening are ...
1@@ 8@@ 3 , 1@@ 20 to one. i have an ap@@ p .
okay. what about the evidence ?
i did ex@@ a@@ mine all 4@@ 1@@ 6 cards in pla@@ y-- they weren 't mar@@ ked. and the sho@@ e checked out .
and i looked at the shuff@@ l@@ er. there 's no sign that either one of them was ta@@ mper@@ ed with .
and you didn 't get anything on the eye in the sk@@ y ?
no. if she was pal@@ ming cards or pulling some sle@@ ight of hand , she was doing it between the video fra@@ mes .
okay , so she 's a ma@@ g@@ ici@@ an. that doesn 't mean she 's not a killer .
i like what she said .
looks like you 're the only one .
so we weren 't the first to to@@ ss kristi holt into the box .
she was de@@ tain@@ ed by casino security right after she left the blackjack table , and then was inter@@ rog@@ ated by her pit boss bobby e@@ spo@@ si@@ to .
that 's them in the holding roo@@ m. check out the time code .
2 : 5@@ 8 a. m .
sikes ' time of death was 3 : 00 .
so holt 's in@@ qui@@ si@@ tion la@@ sted over four hou@@ r@@ s. there is no way that she killed sikes .
so who did ?
well , i hate to admit it , but r@@ us@@ sell may be right .
sikes ' run at the table did draw a crowd .
meaning there are several people who could 've follow@@ ed him out that night .
did you get a chance to look through the rest of the casino 's floor foo@@ tage ?
did you see anybody that looked like they were sha@@ do@@ wing him at all ?
well , i didn 't see anybody who was obviously following him .
wait a minute. freeze it for a second ?
what do you see ?
take it back just a little b@@ it. right there .
that guy , talking to the pit bo@@ ss. i 've seen him before .
you 've seen him before ? where ?
on someone else 's security video .
where 's your friend ?
bus@@ y. just get me this time .
you know , cops keep showing up around here , people are gonna get the wrong idea about my estab@@ li@@ shment .
you gonna return that watch and ring you took or ...
no , they 're still in evi@@ den@@ ce. actually , i am here to look at a few other items .
you gotta be kidding me . - nope .
the surveillance video that you gave us shows this guy coming into your estab@@ li@@ shment sometime after 3 : 00 a. m .
he works for pike 's gambling ha@@ ll. his name 's alonzo pierce .
pierce : uh , 1@@ 4@@ 5@@ 3@@ -- 1@@ 4@@ 5@@ 6 uh , sil@@ ver ri@@ dge road , seven hi@@ lls , 8@@ 9@@ 0@@ 5@@ 2 .
i got his phone number , if you need it .
than@@ k@@ s. actually , what i need is to look at the items that he pawned .
looked like an old tur@@ n@@ table and some speakers .
right , and i would love to help you out with that , it 's just ...
it 's such a mess back there right now , it 's kind of ...
i know where it is .
of course you do , little br@@ o .
yeah , rain man here will take care of you .
okay , uh , tur@@ n@@ table , not valuable .
the speakers , they 're ca@@ di@@ ll@@ ac@@ s. fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy respon@@ se 30 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ tz , im@@ pe@@ dance four oh@@ ms ...
you tried them out , and they didn 't work , right ?
yeah , the left one 's out. how 'd you know that ?
do you mind , uh , letting me bor@@ row that little dri@@ ll over there ?
sure .
thanks .
uh , i 'm pretty good with elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics .
i 'm sure you are .
these speakers , it 's usually just a , like , a wi@@ ring issu@@ e .
well , in this case , i think it might be something just a little bit different .
uh , okay , that 's a lot of money .
i 'm guessing about $ 350 , 000 .
i don 't understand that. if i had that kind of money , i 'd put it in , like , a bank .
unless you couldn 't .
place like this , people drop off an ite@@ m , you keep it for 6@@ 0 days , then they come back to collect .
beats a bank if you 're trying to beat a murder charge .
pike 's casino said alonzo pierce didn 't show up for his shift today .
getting to be a ha@@ bit with their work@@ force .
yeah , a real brain dra@@ in at pike 's .
we bu@@ z@@ zed alonzo 's apartment , no answer .
his manager said he was going on a trip ; he took a small bag .
when was this ? - a few minutes ago .
we got the ex@@ its covered ; he 's not going anywhere .
that 's him .
alonzo pierce ! la@@ s vegas police. you 're under arrest .
sorry , pal , but you 're gonna be disappointed .
it 's the pit boss .
told you .
what the hell are you doing here ?
use your freaking ima@@ gin@@ ation .
get him out of here .
pop the trunk .
alonzo pi@@ er@@ ce. that was a short trip .
yeah , well , nobody stea@@ ls from pike 's gambling hall .
well , at least somebody at pike 's is de@@ di@@ ca@@ ted to their job .
tell you something , bobby , you make detective work look simp@@ le .
i mean , there you are , standing there , gun in your hand , alonzo 's pierce 's body in the trunk .
i mean , all i had to do was call a to@@ w truck .
i 'm gonna make it even easier for you .
i 'm gonna tell you exactly what that little bitch , alonzo , did .
tell me .
you know i seen a lot of chea@@ ts in my time .
but last night , that was different .
i don 't know exactly what this guy and my dealer had going on , but i knew the g@@ rift was on .
it had to be , cause nobody 's that lucky .
see , in the old days , vegas , when guys like sam bra@@ u@@ n used to run the town , we would 've put this guy in a car , done a little car@@ pen@@ try on him .
he would 've given it up .
town 's chan@@ ge@@ d. not for the better .
right , more civili@@ zed now .
you whack guys in the alley .
i didn 't tell him to whack the guy .
i just told him to get the cash back and put a little healthy fear of god in him before he put him on the trail@@ ways bus .
so alonzo killed sikes on his own ini@@ ti@@ a@@ tive ?
and he stole the ca@@ sh@@ . believe that ?
i don 't know what to believe anymore , bobby .
i men@@ tor@@ ed him , and he turns around , this little bitch , and he doesn 't have the co@@ jones to look me in the eye and tell me the truth ?
he has to make up some bs story about he didn 't kill him .
he just rough@@ ed him up , and he put the cash away for safe@@ keeping .
i 'm not gonna lie to you , i @-@ i would 've wh@@ acked him anyway , alonzo , but that 's because he stole from the house .
that 's a matter of honor .
old vegas .
damn straight .
see , you and me , we 're on op@@ pos@@ ite sides of the table , but i know that right here , we 're on the same page .
i 'm gonna ask you a fa@@ vor .
what 's that ?
put in a good word for me at senten@@ c@@ ing .
i 'd like to get sent up to car@@ son city ... with the old boys .
men of honor .
done .
heard you caught a case with day shift .
yeah , lucky me. seems to be case closed .
right. ho@@ m@@ icide , guy 's luck ran out in the alley .
yeah , the casino pit boss sent one of his go@@ ons after the guy .
the goon kills him , takes the money , and then he sta@@ shes it in a ster@@ e@@ o spea@@ ker and then paw@@ ns it .
now , why am i doing this ?
this day shift guy , yeager , really wants this solve , he should be the one finishing up the pa@@ per@@ work .
your victim was stabbed multiple times , wasn 't he ?
yeah , why ?
i don 't know , i 'm just looking at the ti@@ me@@ sta@@ mp@@ s on these photos .
so , the security goon gets his orders from the pit boss at 2 : 4@@ 8 a. m ?
yeah , and then the goon follows him to the alley and kills him around 3 : 00 .
what are you seeing ?
you know , what about the clothes ?
doesn 't this look like the same suit , same shirt , same ti@@ e ?
oh , my god , you 're right .
guy stab@@ s him 12 times , and he doesn 't have a single drop of blood on his clothes .
yeager still hasn 't gotten his solve .
hey , mor@@ gan , i 've been looking for you .
so your security guard didn 't kill sikes .
yeah , i know .
what , ho@@ dges told you about the bullet ?
what bullet ?
the metal fra@@ g@@ ment we found in sikes ' wound track .
we thought it was the tip of the k@@ ni@@ fe , but it turns out it 's from a bullet .
i thought he was stab@@ be@@ d. now you 're saying he was shot ?
yeah , twice .
and then the killer used the k@@ ni@@ fe to dig out the bullets , and then pro@@ c@@ ee@@ ded to stab him ten more times .
to throw us off track .
well , that 's where he made his mistake .
do@@ c thought he recogni@@ zed the wound pattern , so i did some checking , found an open case from two years ago , same pattern .
drug infor@@ m@@ ant was murder@@ e@@ d. person of interest was a luis delgado .
had ties to the ma@@ l@@ a noc@@ he drug car@@ tel in mi@@ ami .
the le@@ tters in blood . " d. e . "
he was trying to sp@@ ell " delgado .
i just ... i don 't get it. why is a big @-@ time g@@ ang@@ ster wasting time with a nobody like jeremy sikes ?
i have an idea about that .
turns out , a month ago , delgado walked in on a robbery at his house .
he got shot , and his girlfriend called it in .
you think sikes was the rob@@ ber .
i do , and the dea has had delgado under surveillance .
check out this pho@@ to@@ . he 's wearing the same ring that sikes pawned at ruby 's .
where is delgado now ?
ow@@ ns a stri@@ p clu@@ b off of fla@@ min@@ go .
i hope these gentle@@ men are up to d@@ ate with their car@@ ry per@@ m@@ its .
what do you want , detective ?
i 'm the b@@ ear@@ er of good news .
you recognize him ? his name is jeremy sikes .
no. should i ?
the guy died two nights a@@ go. two shots in the back , bullets du@@ g out .
sound familiar ? this is the guy who rob@@ bed your house .
i didn 't file any police report .
yeah , well , we recovered this ite@@ m , pawned by sikes .
that 's my ring .
yeah , well , no police report , i can 't return it to you. even in prison .
i think you have me mista@@ ken for somebody else , detective .
you say he was killed two nights ago ?
you see , my mother , she 's very si@@ ck@@ . two nights ago , i was staying with her .
i can prove it. i mean , you can prove it .
so the j@@ ur@@ y 's in ; luis delgado is a beautiful son .
dea surveillance just ali@@ bi@@ ed him out .
okay , but that doesn 't mean that he didn 't get one of his own guys to do it for him .
that 's true , but the re@@ p on delgado is that he 's very hands @-@ on .
so where does this leave us ?
i think we have the right motive , but the wrong person .
so , kristi holt and luis delgado both talked about sikes breaking into their hou@@ ses , and in both cases , they walked in on him .
what if they weren 't the only ones ?
maybe another homeow@@ ner wal@@ ks in on sikes , gets a good look at him when he 's in their house , two nights ago sees him again in the alley , after he was ro@@ lled by alonzo pierce .
i think we have to pull more case files .
yeah , i agre@@ e. go back to the pa@@ wnshop .
see what else jeremy sikes pawned for cash .
okay , what do we got ?
22 items from ruby 's pawn shop , all pawned by jeremy sikes in the last six months .
and all of them can be trac@@ ed for@@ en@@ sically back to five b @-@ and @-@ es , including the break @-@ ins at kristi holt 's and luis delgado 's .
these aren 't your or@@ d@@ in@@ ary b @-@ and @-@ es .
in all five cases , the homeowners walked in on the robbery .
according to this , walked into a bullet .
yeah , well , five b @-@ and @-@ es , four murders and one attemp@@ ted .
only delgado e@@ sca@@ ped death .
so what are we supposed to believe ? this jeremy sikes is just one un@@ lucky bur@@ gla@@ r ?
i thought we agre@@ ed that luck wasn 't a pla@@ yer here .
no , the shoo@@ t@@ ings weren 't an accident , and the robberies were cover stories .
remember how kristi holt left her husband 's watch off of the insurance claim ?
well , the same goes for all of these homeowners .
22 items stolen , and not one of them reported by the victims ' survi@@ v@@ ors ?
i mean , personally , i ... we think that it 's pa@@ y@@ ment for servic@@ es ren@@ dered .
i agree .
we had a case like this up in seattle .
low @-@ rent hit man for hire ring .
ad@@ verti@@ sed in the person@@ al@@ s. called the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves " problem sol@@ vers .
they 're pretty good , too. fle@@ w under the ra@@ da@@ r for a long time .
so how 'd you b@@ ust them ?
caught a break. turned out one of the hit men was a co@@ ke ad@@ di@@ ct .
burned through his money , started sh off his mouth , i guess he became a liability .
cause the head guy decided to hit the hit man .
so jeremy sikes became a liability .
only instead of blow , it was blackjack .
all this loot , he should 've been fl@@ ush , but instead , he was living on the stre@@ ets with his last $ 200 .
sounds like a liability to me .
one that the broker decided to elimin@@ ate by fra@@ ming delgado .
the only question is : who 's the broker ?
kristi , in ad@@ di@@ tion to your husband 's watch , we also recovered these other items that were stolen by jeremy sikes .
the ... the man who broke into my house .
and murdered your husband , simon .
that 's rough@@ ly , we figure , about $ 5 , 000 worth right there .
that 's an awful lot of valuable stuff to forget to report , don 't you think ?
listen , we know that you ... you b@@ ought this watch for simon for your ... your an@@ ni@@ versary , right ?
but you did not buy this br@@ ac@@ el@@ et for him. someone else di@@ d. another woman .
we trac@@ ed the pur@@ cha@@ se back to a ... ti@@ an@@ a lee .
oh , come on , kristi , we under@@ stan@@ d. i mean ... you 're working two jo@@ bs , right ?
and you 're still in deb@@ t because simon spen@@ ds the money as fast as you can make it .
what happened ?
you came back from work one night , he wasn 't there .
he was out again. then he shows up .
maybe he 's drunk .
and you ask him , " where were you ? what were you doing ?
maybe he hits you .
maybe he does that a lot .
and then , one day , someone , a friend , suggests a solution .
and all you can think about is getting rid of that pain , all that sa@@ d@@ ness .
we know that , in your heart , you are not a killer .
and that you ... you feel guilty about all of this .
but this is your chance to get rid of some of that guil@@ t .
by telling us the truth right now .
but you 're right .
about si@@ mon@@ . about the friend .
that person gave me an e @-@ ma@@ il ad@@ dre@@ ss of a broker .
i was told to follow in@@ structions .
they were going to make it look like a robbery , and i was told to leave certain items off the report .
to pay the hit man .
i wasn 't lying when i said that i never met the guy .
him just ... sitting at my table and going on that insane run was just ...
dumb luck ?
what about the broker ?
i paid $ 5 , 000 up front , and they set up a meet .
you remember where ?
at a pa@@ wnshop .
is this the guy that you paid ?
no. i think he run@@ s the place. the broker 's a wom@@ an. older .
she said she han@@ gs out there .
r@@ us@@ se@@ ll. when ?
what now ?
somebody just went into ruby 's pawn shop , shot the place up .
a@@ kers , what the hell happened ?
according to ms. ban@@ ks , two armed men enter@@ ed .
they were looking for some@@ thing. she doesn 't know what .
they shot her son , k@@ y@@ le. took her other son , zeke .
okay. thanks .
who would do something like this ?
i don 't know. but i think you do .
excuse me ?
kristi holt gave you up .
we know jeremy sikes worked for you as a hit man , and we have a pretty good idea how you termin@@ ated his emp@@ loy@@ ment .
what is wrong with you people ?
my son is lying there dead , and now they 've got my other boy , zeke .
ruby , it 's over .
i didn 't kill si@@ ke@@ s. but i know who di@@ d@@ -- it was delgado .
i mean , the word on the street is it 's his signatu@@ re .
two shots to the back , bullets du@@ g out. sikes even tried to write delgado 's name .
that is one hell of a story .
but word on my street is that you 're a soci@@ op@@ ath .
you 're the one who killed jeremy sikes ...
and framed delgado .
and you know exactly who came here and why .
if you don 't come clean , you 're going to lose another son .
come on , ru@@ by. we know how much you love your boy .
okay , you 're right. i killed sikes , but ...
my boys didn 't know anything about the side business .
sikes stole this ci@@ ga@@ r box from delgado , and it wasn 't even worth any@@ thing@@ -- it was a few hun@@ d@@ red bu@@ cks
but what was inside was worth a lot more .
it was 100 gr@@ and in heroin .
where are the drugs ?
i sold them .
but delgado 's guys don 't know this .
zeke , he wanted to protect me , so he lied to them .
he said he knew what they wanted and he would take them to it .
when delgado finds out that he lied , he 's going to kill him .
back again so soon ?
where 's the kid , delgado ?
what kid ?
i know you got him in some base@@ ment , bea@@ ting the hell out of him , but he doesn 't know anything .
you 're not going to get your drugs back because his mother has already sold them .
they 're gone .
are you going to make me ask you again ? where is he ? !
i think you need to start showing me a little more respect .
this is my house . - yeah , right .
look , your la@@ p@@ dog is going to mess on the ru@@ g .
if he doesn 't get his hand off his gun ...
or ... what are you going to do about it ?
now that i have your attention ...
you tell me where the kid is , and we all go home .
or we all got to die sometime .
you 're new in town , so here 's your play .
here 's what the guys in vegas used to sa@@ y-- in the old vegas :
it 's your house , it 's your rules .
you got that right .
i think you got yourself a f@@ an .
no , he just likes the way i handle power too@@ ls .
no , i wasn 't talking about him .
well , congratula@@ tion@@ s. you got your solve .
no. you take it .
i mean , you ear@@ ned it. i 'll catch the next one .
maybe i 'll catch it with you .
i 'll see you around .
yeah .
this is nice .
i 'm glad you could finally get a night off .
you should thank fin@@ n@@ . she 's co@@ ver@@ ing for me .
you have a ... a great group of people here , d.@@ b .
they work so well together , and they 're like a family .
you should feel good about that .
i do .
char@@ lie@@ -- has he made any deci@@ si@@ ons yet ?
no. not yet .
and what about you ?
what 's going on ?
this last trip to seattle , i made a pi@@ l@@ gri@@ mage to that neighborhood that we used to love to drive through , with the house on the hill , with the view .
i remember .
we used to fanta@@ size walking up to the front door , kno@@ cking and asking if they would sell it to us .
i did that .
and they 're an older couple , and they 're very open to the idea .
okay , don 't look at me like that .
you 're serious ?
we have a house here .
we 've talked about this befor@@ e. you can 't do this job forever .
and i don 't want to wait forever for this house .
where 's this coming from ?
i 'm worried about you .
i think ... i think this job is getting to you .
it 's no@@ t. i 'm fine .
i don 't believe that .
well , i 'm fine .
i 'm sorry. come here .
my work here isn 't done yet , but when it is , when that day comes , you and i will go back up to seattle , and we 'll ... we 'll both knock on that door together .
i promise .
i acce@@ pt .
