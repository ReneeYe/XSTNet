hello, mother. - why did you come back?
after all these years, why now? - so, you're maxine's daughter...
i've been talking to the same three people for, like, 10 years.
so it's really nice to- - talk to someone new, i get it.
but sometimes i wish my life was simpler.
i want you to come home, ab. i want us to be okay again.
what happened is done.
it will be just something else; another conspiracy.
boss, your old man died in prison because of this guy.
i told you, when i was ready, we'd deal with mitch mcdeere.
it's time. - i'm sorry guys, we're closed.
mitch mcdeere, i've thinking about this moment since i was 15 years old.
you know why i'm here? - go on, you son of a bitch.
get it over with. - i don't wanna kill you.
i wanna hire you.
when i was 15 years old i made a promise to find you.
and i'm a man who takes his promises very seriously.
i know abby and claire are in kentucky.
i know tammy is working on her divorce in tennessee.
what do you want?
i told you. i want to hire you.
a friend of mine has been charged with murder here in d. c.
his name is patrick walker. i want you to represent him.
you're not serious.
you let me know what it is about my tone that suggests i'm not serious.
he's a good friend.
he's been framed for a crime he didn't commit, and i want him out.
i don't handle racket cases. organized crime is specialized.
you need a lawyer - - i know what i need!
he's not part of my family. he's an economist.
went to school at mit.
works for a big think-tank here in town;
spends his days thinking about job creation and trade deficits.
who did he kill? - nobody.
a woman, allegedly; not that she's nobody, but like i said, he was framed.
joey, i'm just a guy. i never even knew your father.
i'd joined a firm in memphis and everything went wrong.
i never testified - - you helped the feds!
you took down the law firm, which took down my father.
you cannot blame me for...
i'm sorry, i didn't realize we were having a debate.
whose turn is it, yours or mine?
here's my offer. you are gonna handle the case.
that's what you're gonna do for me.
if you do, the mcdeere and morolto families will be square.
that's what i'm gonna do for you.
why me? - because this is what you do best:
uncover the truth.
in memphis... now with nobel insurance, you see what other lawyers don't.
and, uh...
most lawyers just want to win.
you need to win.
a good boss knows how to incentivise his employees.
and if i say no? - you've two choices, mitch.
you can do this for me, or you can wait until we leave, call louis coleman and you can run.
maybe i won't find you. but i promise you this...
i won't stop looking.
i'll be back in the morning.
if you're here, i'll know i have a lawyer.
if you're not, i'll know i don't.
i can't believe he just walked into the office. - they have been watching us for months.
so why not do something sooner? why now? - the case.
he's keeping us alive so we can get his friend released.
and what stops him from killing us after? - nothing. his promise.
we can run. not with the feds, on our own.
we've always had a backup plan. - which would work if we were all together.
we need to make a decision right now.
do we call louis? - or what, work for the mob?
are you really considering this? - yeah, of course i'm considering this, ray.
it's because the alternative is to call my wife, who has just been through a living hell, and tell her that we are running again.
so instead, you're gonna tell her you're working for joey morolto?
look, if we can get morolto out of our lives then maybe she will come back and we will be okay.
but even if you do this, we are nowhere near okay.
let's just talk to the client; one meeting.
morolto said that he is not mob; that he is an economist. - i don't like it.
if something goes wrong we get the hell out of here.
okay, fine. do it.
call louis.
one meeting.
unfortunately, i do still have to charge you for our sessions.
really?
i know you were hoping for that awkward interlude on the balcony with your therapist discount, but...
well, it only seems fair.
is that what you are now, my therapist?
you know, i might take it personally if you hire someone else.
i'm just saying,
i-i don't know how the board of ethics would feel about you kissing a patient.
i mean, that was you wasn't it? you know, it was pretty dark out there.
no, no, that was me. - so...?
so... so i think you need to schedule an appointment right away.
how's tomorrow at two?
two's good.
hey, um that's my other line.
i gotta go. - yeah, yeah, go.
see you then.
hey! - hey.
glad i caught you. - yeah, you caught me.
hey so, my dad's taking claire to work with him at the bank today.
and my mom invited me to lunch.
so, how's it going?
it's... it's not so good, - but we'll see how it goes today. - i miss you.
i know i'm supposed to be giving you space, but i just wanted to...
i just wanted to call and say it. - i miss you too.
look, a client just walked in the office. can i call you back?
yeah. - tammy, i gotta run.
i'll call you back. - may i?
you know, i never liked these but i've heard reagan ate 'em.
he did all right for himself, huh?
you're here - guess that means you're in. - not exactly.
we want a meeting with the client. - i can save you the trip.
he's innocent.
how do you know that? - he told me.
you'll find most people don't lie to me. - you know what i think?
i think if you wanted to kill us you would have done it by now, but you didn't.
you waited, you know why? because this case
this guy, he matters to you.
you don't want us to take this case, you need us to take this case.
i need a meeting.
antonio? - yeah, boss?
get the car. -get the car.
this is him?
mitch mcdeere, patrick walker.
something wrong? - i'm thinking.
are you thinking if something's wrong?
i'm thinking three button suit, which means you will follow trends.
i'm thinking do i want a lawyer who follows trends?
patrick... - i'm thinking charcoal grey feels safe and predictable.
do i want a lawyer who's safe and predictable? - hey! dial it back.
